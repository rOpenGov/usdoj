            From October 27 to November 7, ICITAP’s Engaging Multinational Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) program conducted a surveillance and counter surveillance training for 15 female officers in Jordan’s Public Security Directorate's (PSD) Special Branch (SB). The officers participating in the training are assigned to the SB’s Special Surveillance Unit and/or the newly established All-Female Counterterrorism Team. The training lasted three weeks in total and covered elements critical to physical surveillance operations, such as mission planning, foot and vehicle surveillance, threat recognition, among other topics. This training is the first of two iterations planned for SB in closing of 2024 activities. Via participation in this course, EMPoWER is seeking to strengthen SB’s female officer’s capacity to engage in operational assignments. EMPoWER continues to work with SB to increase the meaningful participation of women in counterterrorism law enforcement. In Jordan, ICITAP-EMPoWER is managed with the support of and in coordination with the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism. #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      From October 28, 2024, to November 1, ICITAP, with support and funding from the U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), trained 19 officials from the Colombian National Police (CNP) and the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) Technical Investigations Corps (CTI) in the planning to solve criminal cases course.

Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the \"Wordly\" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section. The IACP and IMPACT Section annual memberships allow members access to IACP policies, to network, and to gain from emailed policing information including webinars, good practices, and Quarterly IACP IMPACT Section international police Zoom meetings and presentations. Several ICITAP employees and contractors hold key positions in the leadership of the IACP and IACP IMPACT Section, which greatly enhances international police opportunities for all attendees hosted through ICITAP. #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Office of Information Policy (OIP) is pleased to announce that the Chief FOIA Officers (CFO) Council will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday, November 7th 2024 from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM ET.&nbsp;

Bd. of Gvn'rs of the Fed.  Reserve Sys., No. 10-5353, 2011 WL 2162896 (D.C. Cir. June 3, 2011) (Henderson,&nbsp;J.)Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to Board's  decision to authorize the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to provide a temporary loan  to Bear Stearns through an extension of credit to JP Morgan Chase; at issue,  plaintiff appeals district court's decision to grant summary judgment to the  Board, specifically, with respect to records withheld pursuant to Exemption 5Holding: &nbsp;Affirming the district court's grant of  summary judgment to the Board based on its finding that the Board's  withholdings pursuant to Exemption 5 were appropriate• Standard of review: &nbsp;The  D.C. Circuit reviews the \"district court's grant of summary judgment de  novo.\" • Exemption 5  (threshold/consultant corollary): &nbsp;The D.C. Circuit holds that communications  exchanged between the Board and the FRBNY qualify as intra-agency memoranda  under Exemption 5.&nbsp; The D.C. Circuit  rejects plaintiff's argument that \"the Board failed to demonstrate that the  FRBNY's interest is identical to that of the Board\" as required by the  Supreme Court in Klamath.&nbsp; Rather, the D.C. Circuit finds that \"[u]nlike  the Indian tribes [in Klamath] the  FRBNY '[did] not represent an interest of its own, or the interest of any other  client, when it advise[d] the [Board]' on the Bear Stearns loan.\"&nbsp; Noting that the Federal Reserve System  requires \"the Board and Reserve Banks [to] work together\" to achieve  certain national economic goals, the D.C. Circuit concludes by finding  \"[t]hat the Congress requires both the Board and the relevant Reserve Bank  (here, FRBNY) separately to determine that the loan made to Bear Stearns  through JP&nbsp;Morgan promotes the maintenance of a sound and orderly  financial system does not mean that the Board's and the FRBNY's interests  diverged in deciding to make the loan.\"&nbsp; The D.C. Circuit  also dismisses plaintiff's claim that \"the Board failed to show it  solicited the withheld material from the FRBNY as [D.C. Circuit] precedent  requires.\"&nbsp; To the contrary, the D.C.  Circuit finds that the Board's declaration \"adequately demonstrates that  the Board solicited the material from the FRBNY.\"&nbsp; The D.C. Circuit highlights the economic  climate against which the Board acted, noting that the Board \"found itself  reacting to what it believed to be an emergency, as evidenced by its decision  'to provide temporary emergency financing to Bear Stearns.'\" &nbsp;In order  to assess the real-time exposure of large complex banking organizations (LCBOs)  to a Bear Stearns failure, the Board turned to FRBNY which is tasked with  \"monitoring of LCBOs and advising the Board of their financial  condition.\"&nbsp; As such, the D.C. Circuit  concludes that \"to aid in its deliberative process, the Board sought  information from the FRBNY about the financial condition and exposures of  institutions monitored by the FRBNY\" and that \"[t]he FRBNY did not  simply provide the information, unprompted, to the Board.\"&nbsp; • Exemption 5  (deliberative process privilege): &nbsp;The D.C. Circuit determines that the Board  properly invoked the deliberative process privilege to protect certain  memoranda. The D.C. Circuit rejects plaintiff's claim that a \"record is 'deliberative'  only if its disclosure would harm the agency's decisionmaking  process.\"&nbsp; Instead, the D.C. Circuit  finds that \"Congress enacted FOIA Exemption 5 . . . precisely because it  determined that disclosure of material that is both predecisional and deliberative does harm an agency's decisionmaking  process.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the D.C.  Circuit notes that \"[i]t would be impossible for courts to administer a  rule of law to the effect that some but not all information about the decisional  process may be disclosed without violating Exemption 5.\"&nbsp; Additionally, here, the D.C. Circuit  concludes that \"the Board has demonstrated that disclosure of the withheld  material would 'discourage candid discussion within the agency and thereby  undermine the agency's ability to perform its functions\" because it  \"'would impair the Board's ability to obtain necessary information in the  future[ ] and could chill the free flow of information between the [supervised]  institutions and the Board and Reserve Bank[s].'\"&nbsp; &nbsp;• Exemption 5 (attorney  work product privilege): &nbsp;The D.C.  Circuit holds that the Board properly asserted the attorney work product  privilege to protect one document that \"'was prepared by FRBNY attorneys  in anticipation of litigation by Bear Stearns shareholders related to the  Board's authorization to extend credit to [Bear Stearns] indirectly through [JP  Morgan].\"&nbsp; Because the D.C. Circuit  has already \"concluded that the FRBNY did indeed act as a consultant to  the Board,\" it rejects plaintiff's argument against the application of the  attorney work product privilege premised upon his position that \"FRBNY  does not come within the consultant corollary.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the D.C. Circuit finds that  \"[t]he FRBNY, acting as the Board's consultant, prepared the withheld  document for the Board in anticipation of litigation.\"&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Campbell v. SSA, No. 10-2255, 2011 U.S.  App. LEXIS 11267 (3d Cir. June&nbsp;3, 2011) (per curiam) Re: &nbsp;Request for records related to plaintiff's  application for Social Security disability benefitsHolding:&nbsp; Affirming district court's grant of summary  judgment to SSA based on finding that plaintiff's FOIA claim was moot• Litigation  considerations: &nbsp;As an initial matter,  the Third Circuit finds that plaintiff's \"contentions on appeal that the  District Court wrongly concluded that he had abandoned his FOIA claim in [his]  Third Amended Complaint . . . do not provide a basis for upsetting summary  judgment in favor of the SSA.\"&nbsp; The  Circuit notes that \"[w]hether or not the District Court thought it likely  that the claim had been abandoned, the court fully analyzed [plaintiff's] FOIA  claim on the merits in reaching its mootness determination\" and \"[a]ny  error was thus harmless.\"     • Adequacy of  search: &nbsp;The Third Circuit concludes that  \"[t]he affidavits submitted with the SSA's motion for summary judgment  demonstrate that the agency's search was reasonable, just as the District Court  concluded.\"&nbsp; The Circuit finds that  none of the exhibits submitted by plaintiff \"support[ ] his contention  that the SSA withheld documents from him.\"&nbsp;  Moreover, the absence of certain documents in his file \"do[&nbsp;]  not establish, for purposes of defeating a summary judgment motion, that the  SSA's search was not reasonable or that any documents were improperly  withheld.\" District Courts1. &nbsp;The Ctr. for Medicare Advocacy, Inc. v. HHS,  No. 10-645, 2011 WL 2119226 (D. Conn.  May&nbsp;26, 2011) (Kravitz, J.) Re: &nbsp;Request for records pertaining to the  \"improvement standard\" allegedly used by HHS and by insurers with  which HHS contracts in order to deny or terminate Medicare coverage Holding: &nbsp;Concluding that HHS conducted a reasonable  search for records and properly excluded from its search records that were not  created or under the control of the agency • Adequacy of  search/agency records: &nbsp;The court  concludes that HHS is not required to search the records of contractors that  administer Medicare Advantage Plans under Medicare Part C in response to a FOIA  request.&nbsp; Citing the Supreme Court's  decision in Tax Analysts for the  proposition that \"materials only qualify as 'agency records' if they both were obtained or created by the  agency and are under the control of  the agency,\" the Court determines that HHS's regulations providing that  \"'contractor records are not subject to FOIA unless they are in the  possession or under the control of HHS or its agents'\" underscores that  \"even when contractor records were originally created or obtained by HHS,  those records are not 'agency records' for FOIA purposes unless they remain in  the possession or under the control of HHS.\" &nbsp;The court notes that, in accordance with  agency regulations promulgated in 1987, contractors administering Medicare Part  A and Part B \"are treated as part of HHS for FOIA purposes.\"&nbsp; The court notes, however, that \"there is  no regulation that defines Medicare Part C contractors as part of HHS for FOIA  purposes.\"&nbsp; The court finds that  \"[i]t is clear that the Medicare Advantage Plan records sought by  [plaintiff] were not created or obtained by HHS and are not in the control of  HHS.\"&nbsp; Moreover, plaintiff  \"does not allege that the information it seeks from the Medicare Part C  contractors came into HHS's possession at any point – let alone 'in the  legitimate conduct of [HHS's] official duties.'\"&nbsp; The court  further notes that although the Second Circuit has not adopted the D.C.  Circuit's holding in Burka v. HHS concluding  that \"it is possible for an agency to constructively obtain and control records for FOIA purposes,\" even under that  standard, plaintiff would not prevail.&nbsp;  The court finds that under that standard \"the documents held by the  Part C contractors would not be deemed 'agency records,' since there is no  allegation that the agency exercised 'extensive supervision and control' over  the production of the records&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and [plaintiff] has offered  no evidence that the Part C contractors intended to relinquish control over the  records to HHS, that HHS had the ability to use and dispose of the records as  it saw fit, that HHS personnel read or relied on the records, or that the  records were in any way integrated into HHS's record system or  files.\"&nbsp; The court also rejects  plaintiff's arguments that \"Part A, Part B, and Part C contractors are all  'state actors' for the purposes of Medicare, that any of those contractors'  training materials with regard to the improvement standard are thus 'agency  records,' and that '[t]he Court should not accord any credit to HHS['s] failure  to update its regulation [to include Part C plans].'\"&nbsp; For one, the court concludes that, despite  the fact that HHS defined Part A and Part B providers as subject to the FOIA in  its 1987 regulation, \"[n]othing indicates that the regulation codified a  general principle that any private entity that contracts with an agency to  administer the agency's programs is part of the agency for purposes of the  FOIA.\"&nbsp; The court notes that  \"HHS is free to interpret the FOIA's definition of 'agency' to mean that  Part C plans are included within HHS for FOIA purposes\" \"[b]ut [it]  has not done so.\"&nbsp; Moreover,  although Part C was enacted after the 1987 regulations were promulgated, the  court \"sees no reason why the agency would not have amended the 1987  regulation if it believed that Part C contractors should be treated like Part A  and Part B contractors for FOIA purposes.\"&nbsp;  With respect to plaintiff's \"state actors\" claim, the court  \"rejects [plaintiff's] attempt to graft the Fourteenth Amendment's 'state  action' requirement onto the standard for determining whether a document is an  'agency record' under FOIA.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; WEEK OF JUNE 6 Courts of Appeal 1.&nbsp; Prudential  Locations LLC v. HUD, No. 09-16995, 2011 WL 2276206 (9th Cir. June 9, 2011)  (Berzon,&nbsp;J.)Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to individuals  who reported to HUD their suspicions that plaintiff, a real estate company, was  violating the law; at issue are the identities of two complainants, one of whom  requested anonymity Holding:&nbsp; Vacating the district court's grant of  summary judgment to HUD and remanding the matter for further proceedings• Standard of  review: &nbsp;The Ninth Circuit reviews \"under a de novo standard whether an adequate  factual basis exists to support the district court's decision.\"&nbsp; \"If the district court did not have an  adequate factual basis, [the Ninth Circuit] remand[s].\"&nbsp; \"'If an adequate factual basis exists,  then the district court's conclusions of fact are reviewed for clear error,  while legal rulings, including its decision that a particular exemption  applies, are reviewed de novo.'\"&nbsp;&nbsp; • Exemption 6: &nbsp;As  a threshold matter, the Ninth Circuit notes that plaintiff does not dispute  that the documents at issue qualify as \"similar files\" under  Exemption 6 and further comments that it \"express[es] no view on that  question and assume[s] without deciding that the documents qualify.\"&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit then evaluates whether  disclosure of the identities of the two individuals who reported the suspected  violations of the law to HUD regarding plaintiff \"'would constitute a  clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.'\"&nbsp; In terms of privacy interests, the Ninth  Circuit explains that \"[t]he government . . .&nbsp; is not required to establish that a privacy  invasion is certain to occur,\"  but \"[r]ather, it is enough to show a 'substantial probability that the  disclosure will lead to' an invasion of privacy.\"&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit further opines that  \"[t]he marked difference in the statutory text  [between]&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. exemptions [6 and 7(C)] indicates that our  'substantial probability' gloss on Exemption 6 requires a significantly higher  showing that an invasion will occur than the 'could reasonably be expected'  standard found in Exemption 7(C).\" The Ninth  Circuit suggests various privacy interests that the complainants may have in  the disclosure of their identities.&nbsp; The  Ninth Circuit acknowledges that \"if the complainants are or were employed  by [plaintiff], or even if they worked in non-managerial positions in the same  industry as [plaintiff], there might well be a substantial probability that  disclosure would lead to an invasion of personal privacy — namely, revealing  their whistle-blower status could result in stigmatization, harassment, or  retaliation.\"&nbsp; However, the Ninth  Circuit also finds that \"releasing the informants' identifying information  might not threaten any nontrivial  invasion of personal privacy.\"&nbsp; For  example, the Ninth Circuit states that it \"fail[s] to see . . . how  disclosing the names of managerial employees at an industry competitor of  [plaintiff] would infringe personal privacy interests in any nontrivial  way,\" \"because such complaints would have been made primarily for  business reasons, any plausible personal privacy interests would be nonexistent or seriously diminished.\"&nbsp; Similarly, the  Ninth Circuit finds that while \"complainants entirely unaffiliated with  [plaintiff] or the real estate industry might have some nontrivial privacy interest in not being associated with the  investigation, . . . it is doubtful on these facts that any such interest would  mirror the ordinary concerns accompanying law enforcement investigations, such  as fear of retaliation or harassment.\"&nbsp;  Moreover, the Ninth Circuit observes that \"[a]t a minimum, a  cognizable privacy interest would need to be identified, and could then, if  weak, be discounted in the balancing test.\"&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit further notes that it is  possible that \"any risk to personal privacy, if one could be identified,  would be no 'more palpable than [a] mere possibilit[y]' . . . and so  insufficient to justify the redactions no matter the public  interest.\"&nbsp; Lastly, the Ninth  Circuit comments that the complainant might be a public official, who maintains  diminished privacy rights and \"that fact, if true, would be quite  pertinent to the weight accorded personal privacy interests in the Exemption 6  balancing test.\"&nbsp; For the  complainant who requested anonymity, the Ninth Circuit finds that such a  request could \"suggest[ ] he feared some adverse consequences could ensue  from revealing his identity.\"&nbsp;  Nonetheless, the Ninth Circuit concludes that \"absent more  information, [it is] required to speculate about the likelihood that a nontrivial  interest is at stake with regard to either complainant, something [the Ninth  Circuit] is not permitted to do at the procedural stage.\"&nbsp; Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit vacates the  grant of summary judgment to HUD and remands the matter \"to allow the  parties to develop an adequate factual basis for the district court to  determine whether the information at stake may be withheld pursuant to  Exemption 6.\"&nbsp; • Exemptions  7(C) &amp; 7(D): &nbsp;The Ninth Circuit  acknowledges \"HUD's worry that releasing the names of persons who report  suspected illegal activity will have a chilling effect on the ability of  agencies to investigate legal violations.\"&nbsp;  Although HUD admits that Exemption 7(D) is not applicable in the instant  case, the Ninth Circuit observes that \"if HUD is worried about not  discouraging future complainants, it might consider implementing  confidentiality procedures that satisfy the Exemption 7(D) dictates.\"&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit also notes that invoking  Exemption 7(C) might be appropriate given that the \"exemption&nbsp; requires less from the government to justify  withholding information than Exemption 6, both in terms of the likelihood that  an invasion will result and in determining whether such an invasion would be  'unwarranted.'\"&nbsp;  District Courts 1.&nbsp; McKinley  v. Fed. Housing Fin. Agency, No. 10-1165, 2011 WL 2198577 (D.D.C.  June&nbsp;7, 2011) (Kennedy, J.) Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to the  assessment of an adverse impact on systemic risk in addressing Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac, and in particular how the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA)  and the Department of the Treasury determined that conservatorship was the  preferred option to avoid any systemic risk of placing those enterprises into  conservatorship; at issue are two documents for which FHFA invoked the  deliberative process and attorney work-product privileges&nbsp; Holding:&nbsp; Concluding that FHFA properly asserted the  deliberative process privilege to withhold deliberative portions of two  documents; ordering FHFA to produce those documents in camera so that the court  may evaluate the applicability of the attorney work-product privilege; and  holding in abeyance the parties' motions for summary judgment• Exemption 5  (deliberative process privilege): &nbsp;At the  outset, the court notes that \"it is undisputed that the two documents are  predecisional,\" and that the parties only dispute whether they are  deliberative.&nbsp; The court dismisses  plaintiff's claim that \"a document is not deliberative unless the agency can  show that the release of the document would harm the agency's decisionmaking  process.\"&nbsp; Rather, the court  comments that the D.C. Circuit recently rejected plaintiff's argument on this  issue in its ruling in a separate FOIA case, finding that \"'Congress enacted  FOIA Exemption 5 . . . precisely because it determined that disclosure of  material that is both predecisional and deliberative does harm an agency's decisionmaking process.'\"&nbsp; The court finds that \"under the standard  clarified and applied by the D.C. Circuit in McKinley [v. Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System], [the documents at issue] are  deliberative: they are internal documents that were 'provided to . . . senior  policymakers to assist in their deliberations' regarding FHFA's oversight of  the Enterprises\" and notes that plaintiff \"does not contend  otherwise.\"&nbsp; The court notes that  \"'[t]he deliberative process privilege does not protect documents in their  entirety; if the government can segregate and disclose non-privileged factual  information within a document, it must.\"&nbsp;  Here, though because FHFA has claimed the attorney work- product  privilege in addition to the deliberative process privilege, and given that the  privilege does not require segregation, \"to determine whether FHFA has  properly withheld the entirety of both documents, the Court must determine  whether they are protected work product.\"&nbsp; • Exemption 5  (attorney work-product privilege)/in camera review: &nbsp;The court finds that \"the essential  question here is whether these records were prepared in anticipation of  litigation.\"&nbsp; Despite plaintiff's  argument to the contrary, the court agrees with FHFA that the fact the records  at issue serve dual policy and litigation purposes \"does not automatically  preclude [them] from passing the anticipation-of-litigation test.\"&nbsp; The court finds that \"[w]here a document  has a non-litigation component, the key question is whether it 'would have been  created in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.'\"&nbsp; Here, the court concludes that \"FHFA's  affidavits are insufficient to establish that the documents would have been  created in essentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.\"&nbsp; Therefore, the court \"order[s] the FHFA  to produce the two documents for in camera inspection.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Pickard v. DOJ, No. 10-5253, 2011 WL  2199297 (N.D. Cal.  June 7, 2011) (Beeler, Mag.) Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to plaintiff  and regarding the implementation and use of the DEA Agent's Manual with respect  to risk assessment factors for confidential informants Holding:&nbsp; Granting government's motion to transfer the  case based on improper venue; and denying plaintiff's request for leave to  amend his complaint without prejudice with leave to seek to amend in the  district court to which the action was transferred• Venue: &nbsp;The court grants defendant's \"motion to  transfer based on improper venue.\"&nbsp;  The court notes that the \"FOIA and the Privacy Act provide for  venue in any of the following districts: (1) the district where the plaintiff resides  or has his principal place of business; (2) the district where the records at  issue are located; or (3) the District    of Columbia.\"&nbsp;  The court finds that for FOIA purposes, plaintiff who is a federal  prisoner, \"resides where he is incarcerated.\"&nbsp; Accordingly, the court concludes that \"venue  is appropriate in the District of Arizona  (where Plaintiff resides), the Eastern District of Virginia  (where the records are), or the District    of Columbia.\"&nbsp;  \"Given that the records are in the Eastern District of Virginia, .  . . the court transfers the case there.\"• Litigation  considerations/amending the complaint: &nbsp;\"Given the court's ruling that venue  is not proper here, the court denies [plaintiff] leave to amend without  prejudice to his seeking leave in the Eastern District of Virginia.\"&nbsp; 3.&nbsp; Margolin v. NASA, No. 09-421, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 59651 (D. Nev. June 3, 2011) (Hicks,&nbsp;J.) Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to plaintiff's  claim regarding patent infringement Holding:&nbsp; Deferring plaintiff's motion for litigation  costs pending submission of additional information showing costs incurred prior  to supplemental release by agency; and denying plaintiff's request for  litigation costs related to court's summary judgment ruling because plaintiff  did not substantially prevail in that context• Litigation  costs: &nbsp;The court concludes, \"to the  extent [that plaintiff] seeks costs based on the court's summary judgment  ruling, . . [he] did not substantially prevail.\"&nbsp; The court upheld NASA's determinations with  respect to \"virtually every document.\"&nbsp; \"The fact that the court ordered release  [of one, ultimately, non-responsive document] does not alter this  conclusion.\"&nbsp; The court finds that  \"even though [plaintiff] obtained an order partially in his favor, the  relief he obtained was nominal and had little relation to the relief he sought  through this lawsuit – namely, the disclosure of documents related to his  administrative claim for patent infringement.\"&nbsp; Additionally, even if plaintiff were eligible  for costs, the court determines that he is not entitled to such relief because  \"disclosure of the document provides little, if any, public benefit,  [because] the document was non-responsive to [plaintiff's] FOIA request and  lawsuit, and in retrospect the government had a reasonable and legitimate basis  for withholding [it].\"&nbsp; However, the  court finds that plaintiff is eligible for some litigation costs as a result of  supplemental releases made by NASA in litigation.&nbsp; The court finds that plaintiff \"did  substantially prevail to the extent that the filing of this lawsuit prompted a  voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency.\"&nbsp; The court notes that \"[i]f not for  [plaintiff's] lawsuit, NASA would have rested upon its final decision denying  [plaintiff's] administrative appeal of the agency's initial FOIA response.\"&nbsp; Moreover, \"[t]he court further finds  that [plaintiff] is entitled to at least some portion of costs incurred prior  to November 5, 2009, when NASA made its supplemental disclosures.\"&nbsp; In terms of the entitlement factors, the  court finds that although \"[t]he public benefit from disclosure may be  small,\" plaintiff \"seems to have had little, if any, commercial  benefit resulting from disclosure.\"&nbsp;  Instead, plaintiff's interest \"was predominantly personal, and that  interest was substantial.\"&nbsp; Lastly,  the court notes that \"NASA's initial withholding of the records it later  voluntarily disclosed was not based on any asserted reasonable basis in  law,\" but rather its \"failure to conduct a thorough search for  records responsive to [plaintiff's] request.\"&nbsp; The court rules that plaintiff \"is not  entitled to costs of litigation after November 5, 2009, when NASA made its  supplemental disclosures.\"&nbsp; WEEK OF JUNE 13 District Courts1.&nbsp; Families  for Freedom v.

Department of Navy, the  defendants advised the court that its \"analysis is little altered, as  defendants claimed Exemptions 7(E) and High 2 concurrently to those  documents.\"&nbsp; Accordingly, the court  \"address[ed] only the applicability of Exemption 7(E) to the contested  documents.\"&nbsp; The court concludes  that defendants must release the total number of all arrests made each year by  the Rochester Station and the number of transportation raid arrests within the  Buffalo Sector.&nbsp; \"Such statistics  are neither 'techniques or procedures' nor 'guidelines,' such that they could  be properly exempt under 7(E).\"&nbsp;  While the court notes that it \"need not reach whether the  disclosure of such information risks circumvention of the law,\" it finds,  in any event, such a risk is not present here because \"[p]laintiffs are  not requesting arrest statistics for each station within the Buffalo sector,  which could theoretically aid circumvention of the law by publicizing the  relative activity or success of Border Patrol agents in affecting apprehensions  at each station, as defendants  fear.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the court  concludes that \"[t]o the extent that the Daily Reports include arrest data  broken down by station, defendants may redact the information so that only the  Rochester Station arrest data and Buffalo Sector arrest totals are  disclosed.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the court  requires defendants to segregate any nonexempt information from the comments  section of the reports.&nbsp; The court notes  that \"[g]iven the nature of the Buffalo Sector Daily Reports, [it] would  expect the vast majority of information contained therein to be retrospective,  and therefore not to constitute 'guidelines' under FOIA.\"&nbsp; The court also  concludes that defendants may not use Exemption 7(E) to withhold \"charge  codes\" from certain sample arrest forms, which \"'indicate the legal  reason an individual was arrested for violation of immigration  laws.'\"&nbsp; The court finds that  although the arrest forms \"constitute 'records or information compiled for  law enforcement purposes,\" the release of the charge codes contained  therein would not 'disclose techniques or procedures for law enforcement  investigations or prosecutions, or . . . guidelines for law enforcement  investigations or prosecutions.'\"&nbsp;  Moreover, the court notes that \"[g]iven that defendants have  already released [the catalogue of available charge codes], it is difficult to  imagine how the codes cited on particular sample [arrest] forms will compromise  the security of agency databases or otherwise risk circumvention of the  law.\" • Exemption 5  (attorney client privilege):&nbsp; The court  holds that defendants properly asserted the attorney client privilege to  withhold certain training memoranda that \"were created by attorneys in  CBP's Office of Assistant Chief Counsel and contain legal analysis and guidance  to Border Patrol agents regarding the use of race or ethnicity in executing their  duties, and analysis of case law concerning racial profiling in law  enforcement.\"&nbsp; The court finds that  the memoranda \"fall squarely within the attorney client privilege\"  because they \"were 'created by agency attorneys for the purpose of  imparting legal advice to employees of the agency,' and consist of legal  analysis and guidance.\"&nbsp; The court  rejects plaintiffs' suggestion that the \"'agency [should] not be permitted  to develop a body of secret law used by it in the discharge of its regulatory  duties and in its dealings with the public'\" and that the memos should be  released \"'[g]iven the public's interest in establishing that, in fact,  racial profiling is not used [ ] in the course of CBP's transportation  checks.'\"&nbsp; Contrary to plaintiffs'  assertions, the court find that plaintiffs' claims \"do[ ] not come close  to establishing the existence of a body of 'secret law,' particularly because  plaintiffs also concede that the memoranda may describe how CBP officer's  should avoid using racial profiling,  which would be in accordance with the agency's public position.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the court dismisses plaintiffs'  argument that defendants waived their ability to assert Exemption 5 for the  documents by disclosing other memoranda concerning the same general subject  matter.&nbsp; The court declines to address  plaintiffs' arguments regarding defendants' assertion as to the attorney work  product privilege because it finds that memoranda were properly withheld  pursuant to the attorney client privilege. • Exemption  7/threshold:&nbsp; At the outset, the court  notes that \"[w]hile ICE is unquestionably a federal law enforcement  agency, not every document produced by ICE personnel has been 'compiled for law  enforcement purposes' under FOIA.\"&nbsp;  With regard to portions of two agency documents for which defendants  asserted Exemption 7(C), the court finds that the documents \"are not  investigatory files,\" but rather, \"are directives regarding the  general execution of tasks by agency personnel.\"&nbsp; The court comments that \"[w]hile in a  general sense, the tasks described in the two documents pertain to law  enforcement, the documents are not investigatory, and thus, were not 'compiled  for law enforcement purposes.'\"&nbsp;  Accordingly, the court holds that defendants may not use Exemption 7(C)  to protect \"the names of agency personnel who authored or received the two  documents.\"&nbsp; • Exemption  6/threshold:&nbsp; In addition to concluding  that the two documents containing agency directives do not qualify for the  threshold of Exemption 7(C), the court determines that these documents  \"are nothing like a medical or personnel file\" as covered by  Exemption 6.&nbsp; They \"are not  documents 'on an individual'\" and \"[n]either document contains any  personal or identifying information apart from the names of the authors, recipients,  and persons identified as the 'the [SCOs].'\"&nbsp; As such, the court concludes that \"the  documents cannot be withheld under Exemption 6, because they do not constitute  'similar files.'\"&nbsp; • Exemptions 6  &amp; 7(C):&nbsp; To the extent these  documents qualified under the threshold of Exemptions 6 or 7(C), the court adds  that under either standard \"the public interest in disclosure outweighs  the privacy interest\" because \"there is a substantial interest in  knowing whether the expectations and requirements articulated in the memoranda  reflect high-level agency policy.\"&nbsp;  The court finds that disclosure of the names of the agency employees  alone \"in conjunction with the already disclosed content of the memoranda,  will help to inform the public as to 'what their government is up to.'\" • Waiver: &nbsp;The court notes that certain information has  already been disclosed in response to this FOIA request, such as the names of  certain databases, \"thereby waiving defendants' right to claim exemption  for that information.\"&nbsp; The court  finds, though, that \"[w]hile the agency has chosen to release certain  information in the past, that does not mean that it must release other similar  information.\"2. &nbsp;Gianello  v.

[or] place an upper limit for such fees that the requester is  willing to pay, or request that such fees be reduced or waived and state the  justification for such request.'\"&nbsp;  In accordance with the agency regulations, the court finds that  \"[a]bsent demonstration or claim of entitlement to a fee waiver, or  commitment to pay applicable fees, an action is subject to dismissal for  failure to state a claim.\"&nbsp; Here,  the court concludes that plaintiff's \"FOIA request did not comply with  applicable regulations,\" noting that his \"firm promise to pay fees  and costs in the amount of '$00.00' is, on its face, not a promise to pay  anything – it is a promise in form only, and not in substance.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the court finds that  \"[p]laintiff's 'promise' does not constitute a request for a waiver, as it  does not state the justification for any such request.\"&nbsp; The court determines \"[w]hen[, as here,]  a requester declines to provide a firm agreement to pay for, or request a waiver  of, fees and costs, the process is properly suspended pending  compliance.\"&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Pugh  v.

Circuit's decision in Greentree v.  U.S. Customs Service for the proposition that \"an agency may not  refuse to process a request for third party information in the absence of a  privacy waiver because the Privacy Act is 'not to be used as a barrier to FOIA  access'\" is inapposite.&nbsp; The court  notes that Greentree dealt with the  narrow issue of whether the Privacy Act qualifies as an Exemption 3 statute, an  issue not relevant here.&nbsp; As to plaintiff's  request to the Department of State, the court finds that \"the agency's  declaration clearly indicates that the plaintiff failed to make a proper FOIA  request, given that its Information and Privacy Coordinator 'could not process  [the] request' 'without clarification of the records sought[ ] and provision of  [the] additional information [that was] requested.'\"&nbsp; Here, \"plaintiff did not respond to the  Department of State's request for additional information&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  and thus failed to perfect his FOIA request.\"&nbsp; Similarly, the court concludes that plaintiff  did not perfect his request to the CIA where he failed to provide additional  identifying information for two individuals who were the subjects of his  request.&nbsp; • Adequacy of  search: &nbsp;The court holds that the Air  Force, the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the FBI each conducted  adequate searches in response to plaintiff's requests.&nbsp; With regard to the certain component offices  within the Air Force, the court \"is satisfied that [those offices]  undertook 'a good faith effort to conduct a search for requested records, using  methods which can reasonably be expected to produce the information  requested.'\"&nbsp; The court notes that  the agency's \"declaration describes the different databases that were  searched and the terminology used to perform the searches\" and the agency  explained that the search encompassed \"all of the names provided in the  plaintiff's request, as well as the serial number and suspected dates of birth  he submitted.\"&nbsp; Additionally,  \"plaintiff's contention that the Air Force did not certify that it  searched 'all the indices that may contain relevant records,' . . .&nbsp; does not persuade the Court that the search  procedure employed by Air Force was deficient\" because \"'[t]here is  no requirement that an agency search every record system in which responsive  documents might conceivably be found.'\"&nbsp;  The court also rejects plaintiff's argument that Air Force should have  searched for \"'logical . . . [and] spelling variants' of the names  provided in the requests,\" finding that \"the FOIA does not mandate a  'perfect' search, only an 'adequate' one.\"&nbsp; The court  likewise awards summary judgment to the DIA with respect to the adequacy of its  search, concluding that \"the search conducted by DIA was reasonably calculated  to produce the information requested\" where it searched \"its 'two  primary databases'\" using variations of the subject's name and  \"plaintiff has not provided any evidence to show that the DIA acted in bad  faith.\"&nbsp; The court also concludes  that the FBI's search for records pertaining to a third party was adequate,  noting that the FBI searched for cross-references in its central office and  four field offices as well as queried its electronic surveillance  database.&nbsp; Regarding plaintiff's  challenge to the FBI's search for pre-1960 electronic records, the court finds  that the agency's \"supplemental declaration makes it clear that, to the  extent a field office even had records of this sort, those records were  searched and no references to [the subject] were found.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the court comments that  \"plaintiff has not provided any proof to show that the DOJ/FBI acted in  bad faith.\"&nbsp; • Exemption  7(C): &nbsp;The court holds that the FBI  properly invoked Exemption 7(C) in connection with plaintiff's request for  information about a third party for which he did not provide consent, proof of  death, or demonstrate a countervailing public interest.&nbsp; With regard to plaintiff's assertion that the  FBI should have taken steps to ascertain whether the subject of the request was  deceased, the court finds that \"[w]hile on first blush it appears that the  DOJ/FBI should have taken the life status of [the subject] into account, '[t]he  effect of an individual's death on [their] privacy interests need not be  factored into an Exemption 7(C) balancing test . . . where no public interest  would be served by the disclosure of that individual's name or other  identifying information.'\"&nbsp; For one,  the court notes that \"even after death, a person and their relations  retain some privacy interest, and 'something, even a modest privacy interest,  outweighs nothing every time.'\"&nbsp; As  such, the court concludes that in order \"for the DOJ/FBI's failure to  consider [the subject's] life status to be relevant, and actually 'trigger the  balancing of public interests against private interests' under Exemption 7(C),  the plaintiff 'must (1) show that the public interest sought to be advanced is  a significant one, an interest more specific than having the information for  its own sake, and (2) show the information is likely to advance that  interest.'\"&nbsp; Here, the court finds  that plaintiff has not articulated a \"cognizable public interest,\"  noting that plaintiff's stated interest in \"disclosing information about  the activities of [the subject], apparently a third party with no connection to  the plaintiff, . . .&nbsp; and how those  activities might relate to the death of plaintiff's father over sixty years ago  would reveal little or nothing (based on the information provided by plaintiff)  about the FBI's own conduct or shed light on the activities of the government  in general.\"&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Mo.

Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to  government's use of cell phone location data in criminal prosecutionsHolding:&nbsp; Affirming the district court's order  requiring release of specified documents; but vacating the balance of the  district court's decision, and remanding for further development of the record• Standard of review: &nbsp;The  D.C. Circuit \"review[s] the district court's disposition on summary  judgment de novo.\"      • Exemption 7(C): &nbsp;At  the outset, the D.C. Circuit notes that although DOJ asserted both Exemptions 6  and 7(C), it \"need only consider whether [DOJ] properly invoked  Exemption&nbsp;7(C)\" since it \"is more protective of privacy than  Exemption 6' and thus establishes a lower bar for withholding material\"  and \"plaintiffs concede that the requested records&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.  are 'records compiled for law enforcement purposes.'\" &nbsp;The D.C. Circuit first considers the records  that the district court ordered defendants to release, i.e., the \"docket  information (case name, docket number, and court) from criminal cases in which  the government prosecuted individuals after judges granted applications for  cell phone location data without a determination of probable cause, and in  which those individuals were subsequently convicted or entered public guilty  pleas.\"&nbsp; With respect to the privacy  interest involved, the D.C. Circuit notes that although the information at  issue \"by itself [ ] would disclose neither the charges nor the  disposition,\" there is the potential for \"derivative use\" of the  information because \"it would take little work for an interested person to  use the docket information on the government's list to look up the underlying  case files in the public records of the courts, and therein find the  information at interest,\" which plaintiffs intend to do.&nbsp; While acknowledging that information sought  by plaintiffs implicates privacy concerns, the court finds that \"[t]he  privacy interests at stake in this case . . . are considerably weaker than  those at issue in [the] Reporters  Committee\" case decided by the Supreme Court.&nbsp; Unlike the rap sheets that were at issue in Reporter's Committee, the D.C. Circuit  finds that \"even if the docket information [at stake in this case] is used  to find the underlying proceedings, for any particular individual it mostly  likely would reveal only a single prosecution, rather than a comprehensive  scorecard of the person's entire criminal history.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the D.C. Circuit notes that  \"the information at issue here is all less than (and probably quite a bit  less than) ten years old, unlike the Reporters  Committee rap sheets that recorded a lifetime of everything from major  crimes to youthful indiscretions.\"&nbsp;  The D.C. Circuit also reasons that \"[t]he fact that information  about these proceedings is readily available to the public reduces further still  the incursion on privacy resulting from disclosure.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the D.C. Circuit finds that  \"unlike the rap sheet information in Reporters  Committee, the information at issue here is not practically  obscure.\"&nbsp; As to defendants' argument that  \"the disclosures sought here will draw renewed attention to individuals in  a way that the initial disclosures did not,\" the D.C. Circuit finds that  \"[i]t is little more than speculation to suggest that friends or  associates who did not learn of a conviction at the time it occurred (whether  through press accounts, press releases, or other means) will hear of it for the  first time merely because the Justice Department releases a list of docket  numbers, courts, and case names.\"&nbsp;  To the extent that defendants claim that \"the information the  plaintiffs seek is practically obscure because they cannot identify the  prosecutions in which they are interested without the government's  assistance,\" the D.C. Circuit determines that \"all that is  practically obscure is information regarding the government's policy\" with respect to cell phone  tracking, but not the \"information that raises issues of personal privacy – that is, the fact that  particular individuals have been convicted of or pled guilty to  crimes.\"&nbsp; With regard to DOJ's  assertion that the \"derivative use\" of the docket information will  cause an invasion of privacy because criminal defendants or their counsel may  be contacted as a result of any disclosures, the D.C. Circuit concludes that  such an intrusion would be \"marginal\" and also finds that  \"disclosure under FOIA [will not] make that information any more  accessible than it already is through publicly available computerized  databases.\"In contrast, the D.C. Circuit  determines that there is a \"significant public interest in disclosure,  something altogether absent in Reporters  Committee.\"&nbsp; First, the D.C.  Circuit finds that \"[t]he use of and justification for warrantless cell  phone tracking is a topic of considerable public interest: it has received  widespread media attention and has been a focus of inquiry in several  congressional hearings considering, among other things, whether the Electronic  Communications Privacy Act of 1986 . . . should be revised either to limit or  to facilitate the practice.\"&nbsp;  Additionally, the D.C. Circuit observes that \"[c]ourts are divided  as to whether the government must show probable cause before it can obtain cell  phone location data, as well as on related questions regarding warrantless GPS  surveillance\" and notes that \"[t]he Supreme Court has recently  granted certiorari to address the GPS issue.\"&nbsp; As such, the D.C. Circuit finds that  \"[t]he disclosure sought by the plaintiffs would inform this ongoing  public policy discussion by shedding light on the scope and effectiveness of  cell phone tracking as a law enforcement tool.\"&nbsp; The D.C. Circuit rejects defendants' argument  that \"the interest in informing the public discussion is deficient because  the plaintiffs have insufficient evidence that disclosure will show government  wrongdoing.\"&nbsp; Rather, the D.C.  Circuit finds the legality or illegality of such a program \"is irrelevant  to this case.\"&nbsp; Here,  \"plaintiffs are not (or at least not only) seeking to show that the  government's tracking policy is illegally improper, but rather to show what  that policy is and how effective or intrusive it is.\"&nbsp; Contrary to defendants' contention, the D.C.  Circuit also finds that \"[t]he fact that the public already has some  information [on this subject] does not mean that more will not advance the  public interest.\"&nbsp; As to defendants'  argument that consideration of the \"derivative use\" of the  information at issue in terms of identifying a qualifying public interest is  improper, the D.C. Circuit concludes that if it \"consider[s] derivative  use for evaluating privacy concerns, [then it] must do the same for the public  interest.\"&nbsp; In conclusion, the D.C.  Circuit holds that \"in light of the strength of the public interest in  disclosure and the relative weakness of the privacy interests at stake, [it]  conclude[s] that production of the requested information will not constitute an  'unwarranted' invasion of personal privacy under Exemption 7(C).\"With respect to \"plaintiffs'  challenge to the district court's refusal to direct the government to produce:  . . . the list of docket information for criminal cases in which the defendants  were acquitted, or for cases that were dismissed or sealed (and remain under  seal),\" the D.C. Circuit notes that \"the distinction between  indictments resulting in convictions or guilty pleas, and those resulting in  acquittals or dismissals, or cases that remain sealed,\" \"makes some  intuitive sense\" because privacy concerns are potentially greater for cases  that resulted in an acquittal or dismissal and those that are sealed.&nbsp; As such, \"[r]ather than attempt to  resolve [the] question [as to the applicability of Exemption 7(C) to different  categories of these cases, which] may turn out be purely academic,\" the  D.C. Circuit vacates the district court's ruling with respect to these  materials and orders it \"to determine whether any of the docket numbers  refer to cases in which the defendants were acquitted, or to cases that were  dismissed or sealed (and remain sealed).\"&nbsp;&nbsp; Likewise, the D.C. Circuit  concludes that further development of the record is necessary with respect to  the district court's judgment that defendants properly withheld in full the  \"docket number and case name (with personally identifiable information  redacted) of one application to engage in warrantless cell phone tracking\"  and properly redacted \"the docket number of another  application.\"&nbsp; The D.C. Circuit  notes that there are a number of outstanding issues with respect to the nature  and status of these documents that need to be addressed before the propriety of  the defendants' withholdings can be evaluated. 2.&nbsp; Robert v. DOJ, No. 09-4684, 2011 WL 3890446 (2d. Cir. Sept. 6,  2011) (unpublished disposition) Re:&nbsp;  Plaintiff's appeal of district court's grant of summary judgment to  defendants; and his appeal of district court's decision enjoining him from  filing future FOIA actions without leave of the courtHolding:&nbsp; Affirming the district court's grant of  summary judgment to defendants with respect to multiple FOIA cases; and  modifying the district court's final judgment to clarify that the court's  filing injunction with respect to plaintiff applies only to future complaints  raising FOIA claims and not to FOIA requests• Standard of review: &nbsp;The Second Circuit \"review[s] de novo a district court's grant of  summary judgment under FOIA\" and \"review[s] for abuse of discretion a  district court's decision to impose a filing injunction, or 'leave-to-file'  sanctions under the All Writs Act, 28&nbsp;U.S.C. § 1651.\"&nbsp; • Litigation considerations: &nbsp;The  Second Circuit concludes that the district court did not err in dismissing  plaintiff's multiple FOIA claims and rejects the various arguments raised by  plaintiff.&nbsp; Additionally, the Second  Circuit \"agree[s] with the District Court's finding that the DOJ  demonstrated through its supplemental declarations that it had conducted  searches that were reasonably calculated to locate the requested documents  (assuming any exist), and that [plaintiff] offered only conclusory allegations  that were insufficient to rebut the DOJ's showing.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Litigation considerations/filing  injunction:&nbsp; The Second Circuit finds  that \"given [plaintiff's] history of filing vexatious, burdensome, and  meritless FOIA complaints,\" \"the District Court did not err or abuse  its discretion in enjoining [him] from filing further complaints raising FOIA  claims without leave of the court.\"&nbsp;  The Second Circuit clarifies the order issued by the Clerk of the Court,  noting \"[i]t is clear that the District Court intended only to enjoin  [plaintiff] from filing further FOIA complaints without leave of the court and not to enjoin [him] from filing FOIA requests with appropriate government  agencies or officials.\"&nbsp;  District Courts  1.&nbsp; ACLU v. DOJ, No. 10-436, 2011 WL 4005324 (D.D.C. Sept. 9, 2011)  (Collyer, J.)  Re:&nbsp;  Request for information about the legal basis in domestic, foreign, and  international law for the use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones, to  conduct targeted killings Holding:&nbsp; Granting summary judgment to the CIA on the  basis that it properly refused to confirm or deny the existence of records  responsive to the request in conjunction with Exemptions 1 and 3 • Exemption 3/Glomar:&nbsp; The court holds that  the CIA properly refused to confirm or deny the existence of responsive records  pursuant to Exemption 3 in conjunction with Central Intelligence Agency Act of  1949, which protects from disclosure \"the organization, functions, names,  official titles, salaries, or numbers of personnel employed,\" and the  National Security Act of 1947 (NSA), which protects from disclosure  \"intelligence sources and methods.\"&nbsp;  As a preliminary matter, the court notes that \"[i]t is  well-established that both statutory provisions cited by the CIA qualify as  withholding statutes for purposes of Exemption 3.\"&nbsp; Contrary to plaintiff's argument, the court  determines that the CIA properly relies on Section 403g of the CIA Act because  information about drone strikes relates to \"functions\" of CIA  personnel.&nbsp; The court finds that  \"[t]he fact of the existence or nonexistence of responsive information  falls within the ambit of §&nbsp;403g because whether the CIA cooperates with,  is interested in, or actually directs drone strikes pertains to (possible)  functions of CIA personnel.\"&nbsp; Based  on the CIA's declaration, \"which is entitled to 'substantial  weight,'\" the court concludes that \"the CIA is justifiably concerned  that revealing the existence or nonexistence of records sought on the various  topics sought by Plaintiffs could alone reveal information on the CIA's  internal structure and its capabilities and potential interests and involvement  in/operation of the drone program.\"&nbsp;  The court also rejects plaintiffs'  argument that the withheld information is not \"intelligence sources and  methods\" protected by the NSA because \"a program that targets certain  persons for death or incapacitation cannot be deemed a means of collecting  intelligence, so that neither a source nor a method of intelligence gathering  is implicated by the fact of whether CIA has responsive records.\"&nbsp; Although the court acknowledges that  \"[a]t first blush, there is force to Plaintiffs' argument that a  'targeted-killing program is not an intelligence program' in the most strict  and traditional sense,\" it ultimately finds that \"Plaintiffs seek too  narrow a reading of the authority conferred by the NSA to protect 'intelligence  sources and methods.'\"&nbsp; The court  notes that the Supreme Court in CIA v. Sims \"'has recognized the broad  sweep of 'intelligence sources' warranting protection in the interest of  national security.'\"&nbsp; The court  notes that it \"has no reason to second-guess the CIA as to which programs  that may or may not be of interest implicate the gathering of intelligence\"  and concludes that \"taking into account the deference owed the CIA's  declaration in the FOIA context, . . . the CIA's justification for its concerns  about unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources or methods to be both  'logical' and 'plausible.'\"&nbsp; The  court also concludes that \"Plaintiff's argument that a program of drone  strikes cannot form the basis of, or involve, intelligence sources or methods  also ignores the scope of the CIA's specific authority to engage in activities  beyond 'traditional' intelligence gathering (however defined), such as  intelligence activities and operations, covert operations, and foreign  relations activities.\"&nbsp; The court  observes that \"[i]t would surprise no one that the CIA may be authorized  to engage in more than gathering facts around the world; the NSA's grant of  protection to 'intelligence sources and methods' cannot be so  limited.\"&nbsp; As such, the court holds  that \"[c]onfirming the existence or nonexistence of pertinent agency  records on drone strikes could reasonably be expected to lead to the  unauthorized disclosure of intelligence sources and/or methods.\" • Official acknowledgement/waiver:&nbsp; The court finds unavailing plaintiffs'  argument that the former CIA Director \"has officially admitted that some  or all of the requested records exist so that they are no longer FOIA  exempt.\"&nbsp; Rather, the court finds  that the fact that the former CIA Director \"acknowledged that such a  program exists [in a public speech] and he had some knowledge of it, or that he  was able to assess its success, is simply not tantamount to a specific  acknowledgment of the CIA's involvement in such program, nor does it waive the  CIA's ability to properly invoke Glomar.\"&nbsp;  Similarly, the court concludes that general statements made by the former  CIA Director to the news media are not sufficient to demonstrate official  agency acknowledgment, finding that \"Plaintiffs fail to cite any official  disclosure containing the exact information sought by Plaintiffs.\"&nbsp;  The court notes that \"[h]ere, Plaintiffs seek exactly what is not publicly available – an official CIA  acknowledgment of the fact that it is or is not involved in the drone strike  program.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the court finds  that \"none of the comments by former Director Panetta on which Plaintiffs  rely constituted an explicit admission 'that a specific record  exists.'\"&nbsp; Accordingly, \"even  if former Director Panetta could be understood colloquially to have suggested  some sort of CIA involvement in drone strikes, he neither referenced specific  records nor referenced records that go to the exact requests posed by  Plaintiffs.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the court  finds that \"despite speculation or overt factual assertions of the CIA's  involvement in drone strikes rampant in the various articles cited in  Plaintiffs' briefs, the statements of journalists, 'experts,' or even  unofficial or unidentified sources (even were they CIA personnel) are not  'official' disclosures by the CIA.\"&nbsp;  • Exemption 1/Glomar:&nbsp; The court also holds  that the CIA properly invoked the Glomar response in conjunction with Exemption 1 with respect to the information  requested.&nbsp; The court concludes that  through its declaration \"the CIA has sufficiently demonstrated that  disclosure of records sought by Plaintiffs would cause damage to national  security by providing insight into the CIA's intelligence activities, sources  and methods, which are properly classifiable under &nbsp;1.4(c) of Executive  Order 13526.\"&nbsp; The court notes that  in its analysis of the propriety of CIA's application of Exemption 3, it  \"has already determined that the records sought pertain to 'intelligence  sources and methods' under the NSA;\" and, indeed, finds that  \"[i]nformation on drone strikes is even easier to fit within the purview  of intelligence activities\" covered by the Executive Order and that  \"[t]he fact of whether or not the CIA has responsive records would reveal  whether the CIA has an interest in, or can employ, drone technology.\"&nbsp; Additionally, \"[i]ndependently, the CIA  also demonstrates that the fact of whether or not the CIA maintains responsive  records also implicates 'foreign relations or foreign activities of the United  States, including confidential sources.'\"&nbsp;  The court notes that \"[b]ecause the CIA's operations are conducted  almost exclusively outside the United States, they inherently involve foreign  activities.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the  court concludes that \"[w]hile Plaintiffs may hold a general knowledge of  the existence and use of drones, that knowledge does not mean that the  underlying intelligence efforts that reveal and guide weapons to targets are  somehow unprotected under FOIA and open to any requester.\"&nbsp; Noting that with respect to invocation of the Glomar response \"the 'test is  not whether the court personally agrees in full with the CIA's evaluation of  the danger – rather, the issue is whether on the whole record the Agency's  judgment objectively survives the test of reasonableness, good faith,  specificity, and plausibility in this field of foreign intelligence in which  the CIA is expert and given by Congress a special role.'\"&nbsp; Here, the court determines that \"[t]he  CIA has met its burden of showing that the release of any acknowledgment of  responsive records could damage national security; [and, accordingly,] FOIA  'bars the courts from prying loose from the government even the smallest bit of  information that is properly classified or would disclose intelligence sources  or methods.'\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Re:&nbsp;  Plaintiffs' claim that HHS inadequately published financial standards  required for Durable Medical Equipment (DME) suppliers in order to participate  in the competitive bidding process violates the FOIA Holding:&nbsp; Rejecting plaintiffs' claim premised on  Section 552(a)(1) of the FOIA • Procedural/publication  requirement: &nbsp;The court rejects  plaintiffs' claim concerning adequate publication of HHS's financial  standards.&nbsp; As an preliminary matter, the  court notes that \"§&nbsp;552(a)(1)'s publication requirement is subject to  an express exception for actual notice.\"&nbsp;  Here, the court finds that HHS's published rules \"explained the  need for consideration of financial standards, and published particular  examples of standards that would be considered,\" which was \"preceded  by a substantial public education program, and was followed by development of a  website that provided increased detail on the particular financial standards  and ratios to be used in the DME Bidding Program.\"&nbsp; Commenting that plaintiffs \"simply  ignore this publicly-available information,\" the court concludes that they  \"have failed to allege sufficient facts to support an inference that they  lacked actual knowledge of the applicable standards.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the court finds that  \"[t]he second shortcoming with regard to plaintiffs' allegations is the  absence of any adverse effect that plaintiffs have suffered as a result of the  purported non-publication.\"&nbsp;  Additionally, the court notes that publication will not alter  plaintiffs' ability to satisfy the standards, noting that \"[p]laintiffs'  members' financial conditions cannot be changed, but remain unalterable facts that either will or will not meet  applicable financial standards – regardless of whether the Secretary [of HHS]  publishes such standards.\"&nbsp;  3.&nbsp; Smith v.

Sept.16, 2011)  (unpublished disposition) Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to the  Softwood Lumber Agreement between the United States and Canada; in particular,  the details of the distribution of \"meritorious initiatives\" fundingHolding:&nbsp; Vacating the district court's grant of  summary judgment to defendant; and remanding for further proceedings•  Standard of review:&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit  employs a two-step standard of review in FOIA cases.&nbsp; First, the Ninth Circuit \"review[s] de  novo 'whether the district court had an adequate factual basis for its  decision.'\"&nbsp; Second, the Ninth  Circuit \"'review[s] the district court's [findings] of fact for clear error,  while legal rulings, including [the district court's] decision that a  particular exemption applies, are reviewed de novo.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; •  Adequacy of search:&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit  concludes that the district court erred in finding \"that the record before  it demonstrated that the USTR had conducted an adequate search for records  responsive to the FOIA request\" where USTR began its search in June 2006,  even though the program was created in April 2006.&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit finds that  \"[r]estricting the search for documents to that time period in which  'detailed discussion of implementation issues' occurred is simply not warranted  by [plaintiff's] request, which asked for all records related to the implementation of the program.\"&nbsp; Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit concludes that  \"it is reasonably likely that records responsive to [plaintiff's] request  were generated as early as April or May of 2006; by failing to search for  records during that time period, therefore, the USTR did not conduct an  adequate search.\"&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit  also notes that \"a more important point is that none of the USTR's  declarations or Vaughn indices  provide specific information regarding what files were searched, what search  terms were used, why further searches are unlikely to produce additional records,  or why additional searches are impractical.\"&nbsp; Noting that in camera review is disfavored, the Ninth Circuit holds that  \"[o]n remand, the USTR must supplement the record with affidavits that  meet these criteria before the district court can determine whether the search  was adequate.\"&nbsp; •  Exemption 5/threshold:&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit  determines that \"[t]he district court also lacked an adequate factual  basis to rule on the propriety of the USTR's withholding of certain documents  under Exemption 5.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; The Ninth  Circuit finds that \"[m]any of the records at issue here are communications  between government officials and private third parties,\" and notes that  \"[t]his fact alone suggests they do not meet Exemption&nbsp;5's threshold  requirement.\"&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit  concludes that \"[t]he record is insufficiently developed\" as to  \"nature of the relationships between the government agency and the third  party or parties.\"&nbsp; As such, the  Ninth Circuit remands for the district court to consider whether the documents  satisfy the \"inter-agency or intra-agency\" threshold of Exemption 5. •  Exemption 6:&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit agrees with plaintiff  that \"the district court failed to apply the proper standard in evaluating  whether the USTR could withhold the names of third parties considered for inclusion on a board of directors of a  newly-established foundation created to receive 'meritorious initiatives'  funds.\"&nbsp; The Ninth Circuit observes  that \"[i]n assessing the applicability of Exemption 6 on remand, the  district court should 'consider, first, whether the information is contained in  a personnel, medical, or \"similar\" file, and, second, whether release  of the information would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of the  person's privacy'\" and, next, the district court should balance the  privacy interests of the individuals identified in the records against the  public interest in disclosure. District Courts1.&nbsp; Adionser v. DOJ, No. 10-27, 2011 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS105035 (D.D.C. Sept. 15,  2011) (Leon,&nbsp;J.)Re:&nbsp; Requests for records pertaining to  plaintiff's criminal case, and third partiesHolding:&nbsp; Granting summary judgment in favor of  defendants based on the adequacy of their searches and the propriety of their  exemption claims•  Adequacy of searches:&nbsp; The court  concludes that EOUSA and DEA's searches for responsive records were  adequate.&nbsp; With respect to EOUSA, the  court notes that \"[h]ere, plaintiff is challenging the adequacy of [its]  search based on the results of the  search rather than the actual method by which the EOUSA conducted its search.\"&nbsp;  However, the court observes that \"as our case law makes clear,  ultimately, the results of a search do not determine whether the search is  adequate.\"&nbsp; In this case, the court  concludes that EOUSA demonstrated \"compliance with FOIA's search  requirements\" where its declarations \"explain[ed] in reasonable  detail the scope and method of the EOUSA's search.\"&nbsp; Likewise, the court finds that DEA's  \"search was reasonably tailored to plaintiff's request\" where it  searched \"the only DEA records system that would contain criminal  investigative records responsive to plaintiff's request seeking all DEA records  relating to him.\"&nbsp; To the extent  that plaintiff attempts to challenge the untimeliness of DEA's searches, the  court comments that \"an 'untimely response does not entitle plaintiff to  judgment in his favor.'\"•  Exhaustion of administrative remedies:&nbsp;  The court finds that \"[a]lthough plaintiff challenges the adequacy  of the FBI's search for records pursuant to [a specific request, he] has failed  to exhaust his administrative remedies [as to that request] and, therefore,  judicial review is barred.\"&nbsp; •  Segregability:&nbsp; The court finds that  \"EOUSA, FBI, DEA, and BOP released all reasonably segregable non-exempt  information.\"&nbsp; The court notes that  \"[i]n the absence of contrary evidence or specific cites to potentially  unsegregated documents, the declarations are afforded the presumption of good  faith.\"&nbsp; Here, \"[t]he Vaughn indices, declarations, and  annotations identify the exemptions claimed for each individual document and  indicate that any information that could be segregated, was  released.\"&nbsp; With respect to the  segregability of certain recorded telephone conversations, the court finds that  BOP's declaration \"sufficiently states, plaintiff did not provide consent  of all third parties to the calls for release of their portions of  conversations, and because BOP does not have the equipment necessary to edit  digitally stored recordings, the 'withheld recordings of telephone  conversations cannot be segregated and release of the unedited recordings would  result in an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy of other  individuals.'\" •  Exemption 2:&nbsp; The court concludes that  \"[a]s other judges in our court have concluded previously, [Geographical  Drug Enforcement Program identifier codes], [Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs  Information System], telephone, and fax numbers are properly withheld [by DEA]  pursuant to Exemption 2.\" •  Exemption 3:&nbsp; The court finds that EOUSA  properly asserted Exemption 3 in conjunction with Federal Rule of Criminal  Procedure 6(e) to protect \"'grand jury transcripts and attorney notes  associated with a grand jury proceeding,' the release of which 'would reveal  the scope of the grand jury and the direction of the investigation by providing  the identities of the targets of the investigation, the source of the evidence,  as well as the actual evidence produced before the grand jury.'\"&nbsp; The court also finds that the FBI properly  invoked Exemption 3 to withhold \"records consisting of intercepted  communications, which are specifically protected from disclosure by Title III  of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968.\"&nbsp; •  Exemption 5 (attorney work product &amp; deliberative process privileges):&nbsp; The  court concludes that EOUSA properly invoked the attorney work product privilege  \"to protect records reflecting 'such matters as trial preparation, trial  strategy, interpretations, and personal evaluations and opinions pertinent to  Plaintiff's criminal case.'\"&nbsp; The  court also finds that EOUSA properly asserted the deliberative process  privilege to withhold \"a witness immunity request, handwritten attorney's  notes, a warrant affidavit, a property list, a case timeline, and attorney  correspondence,\" the disclosure of which \"'would jeopardize the  candid and comprehensive discussions that are essential for efficient and  effective agency decisionmaking' with respect to litigation  strategy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; •  Exemption 7(A):&nbsp; The court concludes that  DEA properly asserted Exemption 7(A) to withhold a file related to one of  plaintiff's criminal co-defendants who has a pending appeal.&nbsp; The court notes that \"[f]or purposes of  Exemption 7(A), a pending appeal of a criminal conviction qualifies as an  ongoing law enforcement proceeding.\"&nbsp;  The court finds that \"because the file was created for law  enforcement purposes and disclosure of the withheld information could  reasonably be expected to interfere with a pending law enforcement proceeding,  DEA has properly asserted Exemption 7(A).\"&nbsp; •  Exemption 7(C): &nbsp;As a threshold matter,  the court notes that \"EOUSA, FBI, DEA, and BOP asserted Exemption 7(C) to  withhold information clearly compiled for 'law enforcement  purposes.'\"&nbsp; Moreover, the court  finds that it is \"well-settled\" that information relating to  \"the identity of third parties, special agents, government employees, and  local law enforcement personnel,\" for whom Exemption 7(C) was invoked,  \"have a substantial interest in their anonymity.\"&nbsp; The court concludes that \"there is no  public interest asserted by plaintiff that outweighs such a substantial privacy  interest.\"&nbsp; Accordingly, defendants  properly asserted Exemption 7(C) with respect to this third party  information.&nbsp; •  Exemption 7(D):&nbsp; The court determines  that DEA and EOUSA properly asserted Exemption 7(D) to protect information  withheld based on an express grant of confidentiality where their submissions  \"refer to notations on the withheld documents – specifically the EOUSA's  'CI' notation and the DEA confidential informant code.\"&nbsp; The court notes that \"[s]uch notations  provide probative evidence that the source received an express grant of  confidentiality.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the  court finds that, with regard to information withheld pursuant to an implied  grant of confidentiality, the assertion of Exemption 7(D) was appropriate  because, based on the violence inherent with illicit drug trafficking,  \"[i]t is reasonable to conclude that these sources disclosed information  in confidence due to the fear of reprisal.\"&nbsp; •  Exemption 7(E):&nbsp; The court holds that the  FBI properly asserted Exemption 7(E) to withhold \"law enforcement  techniques and procedures that relate to the identification and contents of the  FBI databases.\"&nbsp; The court finds  that the FBI \"provides a reasonable explanation for why disclosure of such  information could impede investigations.\"&nbsp; •  Exemption 7(F): &nbsp;The court determines that DEA properly invoked  Exemption 7(F) in order \"to protect the physical safety\" of \"special  agents, law enforcement officers, government employees, and confidential  sources.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Sept. 15, 2011) (Walton, J.)Re:&nbsp; Request for records pertaining to deaths of  immigrants in DHS custodyHolding:&nbsp; Granting plaintiff an award of attorney fees,  but making certain deductions based on a computational error and unreasonable  billing entries•  Attorney fees:&nbsp; The court grants  plaintiff an award of attorney's fees, deducting certain billing entries that  were not reasonable.&nbsp; Eligibility: In terms of assessing  plaintiff's eligibility for attorney fees, the court first notes that  \"[t]his Court has found that FOIA litigation substantially caused the  release of documents when the 'defendant's own affidavits stated that the  review of the documents from which [the released] pages were drawn was being  done\" incidental to the preparation of \"one of its Vaugh[n] affidavits.'\"&nbsp; Here, the court finds that \"defendants'  own submissions admit that at least some of the documents were produced as a  result of preparing Vaughn indexes\" and concludes that since these records would \"not have been produced  without litigation; accordingly, the litigation substantially caused the  defendants to release these documents.\"&nbsp;  In addition, the court determines that litigation caused the defendants  to continue to search for and produce records after they had filed a report  indicating that their response to plaintiff's request was complete.&nbsp; The court rejects defendants' contention that  \"some of these records were released as a result of new guidelines  implemented by President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder, and not as a  result of this litigation.\"&nbsp; The  court notes that the Attorney General's memoranda \"plainly states that the  plaintiff's FOIA request was eligible for review [under the new guidelines] because  it was already in litigation at the time the policy change was  issued.\"&nbsp; The court concludes that  \"while the release of some records may have been 'precipitated' by the  change in policy, . . .&nbsp; the release of  these records was substantially caused by the litigation.\"&nbsp; Based on the foregoing factors, the court  finds that plaintiff is \"eligible\" for attorney's fees.&nbsp; Entitlement: As to the entitlement factors, the court notes that \"defendants do not  dispute that the first three factors [i.e., the benefit to the public,  commercial benefit to the requester, and nature of the requester's interest in  the records] favor the plaintiff's 'entitlement' to attorneys' fees.\"&nbsp; However, with respect to the fourth  entitlement factor, the court concludes that \"[p]utting aside the exempt  documents [for which the court upheld exemptions asserted by the government],  the defendants did not have a reasonable basis for withholding the 8,500 pages  of records that were produced after the defendants had 'completed processing  and production of all records,' . . . because 'defendant's failure to produce  documents due to backlog or administrative issues does not constitute a  \"reasonable basis in law.'\"&nbsp;  Moreover, \"[c]onsidering the immense public benefit derived from  the disclosure of information concerning ten previously undisclosed deaths, and  the plaintiff's total lack of any commercial benefit acquired from the  disclosure, the Court finds that [ ] even if the 'reasonable basis in law'  factor weighs in favor of the defendants, the other factors nonetheless weigh  in favor of the plaintiff being 'entitled' to an award of attorneys'  fees.\" •  Attorney fees/reasonableness: &nbsp;At the outset, the court makes a deduction  \"from the requested award to account for [a] mathematical  error.\"&nbsp; In response to defendants'  objection to plaintiff's entries based on \"block billing supported by  quarter-hour billing,\" the court observes that \"[t]he problem with  the practice is that 'billing by the quarter-hour, not by the tenth is a  deficient practice because it does not reasonably reflect the number of hours  actually worked.'\"&nbsp; However, the  court ultimately \"adopt[s] the same approach taken by another member of  this Court and 'allow [p]laintiff's counsel’s quarter-hour billing increments,  but caution[ ] counsel that future time sheets submitted to the Court must  reflect billing entries in six-minute increments.\"&nbsp; With respect to the reasonableness of other  billing entries, the court \"agrees . . . with defendants that some of the  billing entries must be excluded from the award\" and deducts the billing  entries related to press communications, a retention letter, and excessive time  spent by a junior associate in drafting the complaint.&nbsp; 4.&nbsp;North  v.

Department of the Navy represents \"an intervening change in the  controlling law for its case.\"&nbsp; The  court rejects plaintiff's claim that \"Rule 54(b) is an appropriate vehicle  for requesting such reconsideration because, in light of the pending motion for  statutory attorney's fees, the court's Order should not be considered a 'final  judgment,' but rather an interlocutory decision.\"&nbsp; The court notes that \"[i]f a court has  resolved the merits of a case through a final order and only a statutory  request for attorney's fees remains, the merits of the case are no longer  pending for appeal purposes and the judgment is considered final and  immediately appealable.\"&nbsp; Here,  \"[b]ecause the court's January 12, 2011 Order constitutes a final judgment  as opposed to an interlocutory order, the plaintiff's motion seeking relief  upon reconsideration of that Order is not properly brought under Rule 54(b),  which can only be used to seek reconsideration of interlocutory  orders.\"&nbsp; As for plaintiff's Rule  60(b)(1) motion, the court finds that such a motion, when \"brought due to  a change in controlling law[,] is timely only if either the movant has already  filed an appeal or if the movant files its motion for relief within the appeal  period.\"&nbsp; In this case,  \"plaintiff, despite knowing that Milner had been granted certiorari by the Supreme Court, . . . did not file its motion  for relief upon reconsideration until ten days after the appeal period  closed.\"&nbsp; The court concludes that  \"allowing the plaintiff to artificially extend its appeal time period in  this fashion would embrace an interpretation of the reasonable time limits for  a Rule 60(b)(1) motion that would undermine the finality of the court's  judgment and promote uncertainty.\"&nbsp;  Lastly, the court \"determines that the plaintiff[ ] may not seek  relief upon reconsideration under Rule 60(b)(6),\" noting that \"the  change in law presented by Milner is  not considered an 'extraordinary circumstance' under [that] Rule.\"  •  Attorney fees:&nbsp; The court grants, in  part, and denies, in part, plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees.&nbsp; Eligibility:&nbsp; As a preliminary matter, the court notes that  \"DHS does not reject the plaintiff's claim that it substantially  prevailed.\"&nbsp; Additionally, the court  finds that in this case \"plaintiff's lawsuit has clearly elicited a  'voluntary or unilateral change in [DHS's] position'\" because documents  were only produced after litigation was initiated and DHS did not \"seek to  take advantage of the statutory mechanisms available to extend its response  time.\"&nbsp; Moreover, the court rejects  defendant's arguments that \"its failure to disclose non-exempt documents  was due to 'backlog as well as administrative error,'\" concluding that  \"these generic statements – without any evidence demonstrating that a  backlog existed or that the agency performed its due diligence in processing  plaintiff's FOIA requests – are insufficient to show that DHS experienced  'unavoidable delay' despite due diligence in the administrative  process.'\"&nbsp; Accordingly, the court  finds plaintiff is eligible for attorney's fees.&nbsp; Entitlement: The court holds that plaintiff is also entitled to an award of attorney's  fees.&nbsp; In terms of the public benefit  factor, the court finds that \"[t]he records disclosed to the plaintiff in  the course of this litigation have provided a public benefit in that they were  covered extensively in the news and cited frequently as a news source during  the public debate surrounding the use of whole body imaging devices in  airports.\" Accordingly, the court concludes that \"the records  released in the course of this litigation 'further[ed] public understanding,' .  . . in that the thrust of the information obtained by the plaintiff is 'likely  to add to the fund of information that citizens may use in making vital  political choices.'\"&nbsp; The court also  finds that \"the 'commercial benefit' and 'nature of interest' elements  weigh in favor of granting the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees\"  because \"plaintiff is a '501(c)(3) non-profit public interest research  center' . . . [that] derived no commercial benefit from its FOIA request or  lawsuit\" and \"[i]ts aims, which include dissemination of information  regarding privacy issues to the public . .&nbsp;  fall within the scholarly and public-interest oriented goals promoted by  FOIA.\"&nbsp; As to then final entitlement  factor, i.e., the reasonable basis in law for withholding the information,&nbsp; \"because DHS's administrative delay and  a generic claim of a FOIA backlog do not form a 'reasonable basis in law' for  withholding in these circumstances, . . . and because DHS has not provided any  other reasonable basis in the law for its failure to respond to the plaintiff's  two FOIA requests, the court determines that this factor also weighs in favor  of granting the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees.\"•  Attorney fees/reasonableness:&nbsp; At the outset, the court notes that  \"both parties have effectively assented to the use of the Laffey Matrix as an appropriate baseline  for any fee award.\"&nbsp; The court finds  that \"plaintiff's request for attorney's fees warrants a reduction due to  several instances of duplicative or excessive billing.\"&nbsp; For one, the court concludes that  \"because both complaints in this case consist largely of boilerplate  language and an uncomplicated factual history, . . . the twenty hours spent  between them is unreasonable.\"&nbsp;  Next, the court determines that an award of fees is not appropriate for  an unsuccessful motion for summary judgment which \"can be reasonably  separated from the portion of the litigation that catalyzed the release of  responsive records\" as well as for \"unnecessary work\" associated  with a motion that was never entered.&nbsp;  However, the court \"awards fees related to the plaintiff's review  of DHS's [pre-litigation] disclosures\" because \"it would seem critical  to the prosecution of a FOIA lawsuit for a plaintiff to review an agency's  disclosure for sufficiency and proper withholding during the course of its FOIA  litigation.\"&nbsp; With respect to fees  incurred in preparing plaintiff's fee petition, the court awards \"'fees on  fees'\" because \"upon close scrutiny of the record, . . . the hours  spent by plaintiff on these tasks were reasonably expended and do not  constitute a 'windfall' for the attorneys.\"&nbsp; However, the court concludes that plaintiff  is not entitled to a fee enhancement based on its experience litigating such  matters because the Laffey Matrix  formula already \"incorporate[s] higher fees for greater experience\"  and \"would therefore compensate the plaintiff sufficiently in this  case.\"&nbsp; The court also finds that  plaintiff is not eligible for a fee enhancement based on \"its 'unusually  exhaustive administrative filings,'\" noting that \"work performed at  the administrative level is not compensable under FOIA.\"&nbsp; In terms of defendant's arguments that fees  should be reduced by 50 percent, the court concludes that \"[a]ny  deficiencies that [have been] noted in the plaintiff's fee request have not  rendered the plaintiff's request 'outrageously unreasonable'\" and  therefore the fee request \"does not approach a level of impropriety that  would prompt the court to further reduce the plaintiff's attorney's fee  award.\"&nbsp; WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 19 District Courts 1.&nbsp; Rimmer v. Holder, 10-1106, 2011 U.S.  Dist. LEXIS107883 (M.D. Tenn. Sept.  22, 2011) (Trauger,&nbsp;J.)Re:&nbsp; Requests for records pertaining to criminal  investigation of plaintiff, and information related to third partiesHolding:&nbsp; Granting summary judgment to defendants based  on the propriety of their withholdings•  Exemption 7(C):&nbsp; As an initial matter,  the court notes that although the FBI claimed Exemptions 6 and 7(C) for certain  records, \"[b]ecause all of the redacted records were compiled for law  enforcement purposes, and because Exemption 7(C) provides broader privacy  protections than Exemption 6, the court can resolve this motion by largely  focusing on Exemption 7(C).\"&nbsp; Based  on an in camera review of the records  at issue, the court concludes that the FBI properly asserted Exemption 7(C) to  protect the identities of FBI agents and employees, third parties who provided  information to law enforcement, state and local law enforcement officials,  individuals of investigative interest, victims, and the rap sheets of third  parties.&nbsp; In terms of the privacy  interests involved, the court finds that \"[t]he defendants' suggestion  that it is an 'invasion of personal privacy' to release to the public the names  and identifying information of those involved in law enforcement investigations  is well supported by the case law\" and notes that the FBI's declaration  also identifies the harms that could be occasioned by disclosure.&nbsp; On the other  hand, the court finds that \"the first 'countervailing public benefit'  identified by the plaintiff, [namely,] that the unredacted production would be  a tool to aid him in his underlying state collateral review proceedings, is an  illegitimate one.\"&nbsp; Rather, the  court determines that \"[t]he purposes of civil discovery (which aids the  litigant) and FOIA (which aids the public at large) are clearly distinct, and  FOIA does not serve as a 'substitute for the normal process of discovery in  civil and criminal cases.'\"&nbsp; As to  plaintiff's claim that \"it is in the public interest to know whether the  'FBI might be withholding information that could corroborate a death row  inmate's claim of innocence,'\" the court finds that \"[w]hile there is  undoubtedly a public interest in shedding light on how the federal agencies  operate and whether they could work to imprison someone illegitimately, the  specific information being withheld does not shed light on how the FBI works or  if the FBI is engaged in conduct that might have resulted in an innocent man  being sentenced to death.\"&nbsp; Instead,  the court notes \"the information being withheld is, by and large, the  names and identifying information of people who happened to be involved in the  investigation\" of plaintiff and, as the Supreme Court recognized in Reporters Committee, \"[t]his  information . . . does not generally assist the public in determining whether  the agency is performing its duties properly.\"&nbsp; The court notes that plaintiff's reliance on  the D.C. Circuit's decision in Roth v.  U.S. Department of Justice, which found that \"a death sentence  'strengthened the public's interest in knowing whether the FBI's files contain  information that could corroborate an innocence claim,'\" is not applicable  here, because, in contrast to Roth,  the FBI did not invoke a Glomar response and the documents were reviewed by the court in camera. As such, the court concludes that public  interest implicated by the records is \"negligible,\" and weighing this  minimal public interest \"against the recognized privacy interests at  issue, and it is clear that the defendants are properly redacting names and  indentifying information of those connected with the law enforcement  investigation.\" •  Exemption 7(D):&nbsp; With respect to  defendants' \"relatively few invocations of Exemption&nbsp;7(D),\" the  court gives no weight to plaintiff's assertion that \"he has become aware  of the names of the individuals that the defendants seek to protect through  redaction, along with some of the information that they provided, and that most  of this information is contained in state law enforcement files that should  have been disclosed at the time of his trial.\"&nbsp; Rather, the court finds that \"[i]t is  well settled . . . that the identity of confidential informants and the  information they provide is to be protected under FOIA, even if 'a confidential  source is later revealed.'\" •  Segregability:&nbsp; Although the court notes  that \"[t]here are a handful of places in the record\" where  defendants' assertion of Exemption 7(C) \"does not provide information that  is facially 'identifying'\" to an individual, it \"presumes that the  defendants are being extremely 'careful' to redact information that could, if  certain connections between individuals were made, arguably be used to identify  particular individuals who provided information to law enforcement that was  damaging to the plaintiff.\"&nbsp;  Therefore, \"given the challenges posed by the 'reasonable  segregability' standard, and the heightened privacy protections that are owed  to these individuals who willingly provide potentially incriminating  information to law enforcement and the fact that none of the information  redacted sheds light on how the Government entity actually performs its  functions or suggests that the government agency has been involved in  imprisoning an innocent individual, [the court concludes that] the redactions  are not inappropriate.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; James v.

Sept. 19, 2011) (Coffin, Mag.)Re:&nbsp; Requests for records regarding plaintiffs'  son's prison transfer and the incident that led to his shooting death in  federal prison; at issue is whether BOP conducted an adequate search for  responsive records Holding:&nbsp; Granting BOP's renewed motion for summary  judgment based on the adequacy of its search•  Adequacy of search:&nbsp; The court concludes  that the supplemental declaration submitted by BOP establishes that it  \"has performed an adequate search,\" where the declaration  \"described the search methods employed – including the electronic search  terms used, the locations of the files searched and the method in which the  searched files were created.\"&nbsp;  Moreover, although plaintiffs \"speculate that additional responsive  records exist, they do not present anything in support of this speculation  beyond their conclusory statements.\"&nbsp;  The court also notes that, contrary to plaintiffs' arguments,  \"BOP's failure to comply with FOIA's twenty day [response] deadline does  not preclude summary judgment in the agency's favor.\"5.Sensor  Sys. Support, Inc. v. FAA, No. 10-262, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 108142 (D.N.H.  Sept.&nbsp;16, 2011) (Barbadoro, J.)Holding:&nbsp; Granting FAA's motion to dismiss or, in the  alternative, for summary judgment, but delaying entry of final judgment twenty  days in order to allow plaintiff to file an amended complaint to set forth a  claim for relief•  Litigation consideration:&nbsp; The court  determines that plaintiff \"has made a conclusory allegation in the  complaint that 'the FAA has wrongfully withheld agency records'\" premised  on the FAA's failure to act on an administrative appeal of its initial  determination within 20-days as set forth by the FOIA.&nbsp; The court finds that \"[t]he FOIA does  not . . . authorize a court to review an agency's failure to act on an  appeal\" and, as such, plaintiff's \"complaint does not plead  sufficient facts to support a claim for relief under [the FOIA].\"&nbsp; Accordingly, the court grants defendant's  motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment, but  \"delay[s] entry of final judgment for 20 days to give [plaintiff] an  opportunity to file an amended complaint setting forth a claim for relief under  §&nbsp;552(a)(4)(B).\"&nbsp; #> 3

                              OIP Issues Guidance for 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports OIP has issued guidance on  the content of agency 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports which are required to be  submitted to the Department of Justice each year, in accordance with the Attorney General’s  FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; As has been done in  the past two years, agencies are asked to describe the steps taken to improve  transparency in five key areas, specifically:&nbsp;  1) the steps taken to apply the presumption of openness; 2) the steps  taken to ensure that the agency has an efficient and effective system in place  for responding to requests; 3) steps taken to increase proactive disclosures;  4) steps taken to improve use of technology;&nbsp;  and 5) steps taken to reduce any backlogs and improve timeliness in  responding to requests.  The specific items to be addressed in 2012 for each  of the five key areas have been refined and updated.&nbsp; Agencies should review the elements now to  facilitate their planning for the next six months.&nbsp; For 2012 there is a new stand-alone reporting  requirement that asks agencies to state how many times, if any, they employed  any of the FOIA’s statutory “exclusions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;  Lastly, as was done last year, agencies are asked to highlight a  particular success story relating to transparency that was accomplished since  the filing of last year’s report.*November 9, 2011:  To be of further assistance to agencies in the preparation and completion of their 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports, we have included a template for the report with this updated article. #> 4

focused on the FOIA’s  fee and fee waiver provisions.&nbsp; This FOIA  Fee Summit will be held on May 17, 2011.&nbsp; The FOIA has a rather complicated  system that agencies must employ in determining the appropriate fees to be charged.&nbsp; The FOIA first provides for the charging of three  different types of fees applicable to the processing of requests.&nbsp; It then establishes three distinct categories  of FOIA requesters. The different fees that can be assessed by agencies depend  on the fee category applicable to each requester.&nbsp; The FOIA also imposes various restrictions on  the charging of certain fees, including restrictions that are tied to the time  it takes the agency to respond to the request. &nbsp;In addition to the various fee provisions, the  FOIA contains a standard for the waiver of fees “if disclosure of the  information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute  significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the  government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the  requester.”&nbsp; To implement this fee waiver  standard agencies must consider six different factors.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;OIP’s Fee Summit is designed to address  the issues that arise most frequently in connection with assessing fees under  the FOIA and in determining whether a fee waiver is appropriate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Discussion  and questions are encouraged.

to adjudicate requests for expedited processing and requests for a fee waiver in order to comply with the requirements of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, as set forth in Section VIII of the 2008 Guidelines for Agency Preparation of Annual FOIA Reports?Answer: Requests for Expedited Processing: Agencies should count calendar days starting from the day they receive the request for expedited processing through the day they provide notice to the requester of their determination to grant or deny the request for expedited processing.Requests for Fee Waiver: Unlike requests for expedited processing, the period of time to adjudicate a fee waiver request does not necessarily begin with receipt of the fee waiver request itself, nor does it necessarily conclude with a separate letter sent to the requester. As a result, in order to calculate the number of days taken to adjudicate requests for a fee waiver, agencies should count each working day spent considering whether to grant or deny the request for a fee waiver. Thus, agencies will need to be sure that they establish a tracking procedure that allows them to capture the distinct number of days taken to adjudicate a fee waiver request. #>   changed created date teaser                      title #> 1    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> Summaries of New Decisions #> 2    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> Summaries of New Decisions #> 3    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA>                  FOIA Post #> 4    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA>                  FOIA Post #> 5    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA>                  FOIA Post #> 6    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> Annual FOIA Report Q&amp;A #>                                                                     url #> 1              https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/summaries-new-decisions #> 2            https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/summaries-new-decisions-0 #> 3                          https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-3 #> 4                          https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-7 #> 5                          https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-0 #> 6 https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2008-annual-foia-report-qa #>                                   uuid name #> 1 92fd0262-f1c2-4909-aba1-7268de6c6ee8 <NA> #> 2 bc4c4e22-27ce-4034-bc09-fb125246b035 <NA> #> 3 2a072215-e297-41ef-bcbb-03b85beba1a3 <NA> #> 4 79fd0336-1ead-4944-8c2f-eaa0ee1d558d <NA> #> 5 d74c2176-d6ee-4f23-ade5-5f4c9df1a149 <NA> #> 6 6866f0a4-7293-4a21-bdac-1c547a35e083 <NA>"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"accessing U.S. Department Justice (DOJ) open data press releases.","code":""},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"","code":"doj_press_releases(     n_results = 50,     search_direction = \"DESC\",     keyword = NULL,     clean = TRUE   )"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"n_results number results return. default, 50 results returned. search_direction Set ASC DESC fetch data starting least recent entries. default, data sorted descending order (recent entries). keyword return results containing keyword.

Trump and the citizens of my home state of New Jersey has been a great honor.&nbsp; I am particularly proud of the impactful and meaningful work of this office and our law enforcement partners to uphold the rule of law and safeguard our nation.&nbsp; I look forward to continuing to serve the President in my forthcoming role, and I remain committed to advancing the important work of his Administration.”U.S. Attorney John GiordanoDuring his tenure, Giordano led the office in prosecuting significant and complex cases for the District of New Jersey.&nbsp; Under his leadership, the office worked closely with the dedicated and talented men and women of our law enforcement community to take back America.&nbsp; Giordano aggressively targeted violent gang activity, human trafficking networks, illegal immigration, and the ability of cartels to flood our streets with fentanyl and other deadly drugs.&nbsp; Giordano made it very clear, notably through both the conviction of individuals attempting to support ISIS and the extradition to the District of New Jersey of a dual Russian and Israeli national on charges he was a developer of the LockBit ransomware group, that if you commit crimes against the United States regardless of where you hide, we will find you and bring you to justice.As the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey, Mr. Giordano oversaw all federal criminal prosecutions and civil litigation involving federal interests in the State.&nbsp; With offices in Newark, Camden, and Trenton, he supervised a dedicated staff of approximately 153 federal prosecutors and 104 support personnel.Following the departure of U.S. Attorney Giordano, Alina Habba will serve as the new U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. #> 2

                                         An indictment was unsealed yesterday charging Mohammad Jawaid Aziz, also known as Jawaid Aziz Siddiqui and Jay Siddiqui, 67, of Pakistan and Canada, with conspiracy to violate U.S. export laws and violating U.S. export laws. Siddiqui was arrested on March 21 in the Western District of Washington while attempting to cross into the United States from Canada. He remains detained, pending transfer to the District of Minnesota.As alleged, from as early as 2003 through approximately March 2019, Siddiqui operated an illicit procurement network through his Canada-based company Diversified Technology Services. The purpose of the network was to obtain U.S.-origin goods on behalf of prohibited entities in Pakistan that were associated with the country’s nuclear, missile, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) programs.According to the indictment, Siddiqui, while operating through Diversified Technology Services, procured various goods – including sensitive and restricted items subject to export administration regulations (EAR) and those on the Commerce Control List – from U.S. companies on behalf of the restricted entities in Pakistan. As alleged, Siddiqui and his co-conspirators worked to conceal the true end-users of the goods from U.S. companies, often using front companies and transshipping goods through third countries to evade detection.Siddiqui is charged with conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and Export Control Reform Act, which carries a maximum statutory penalty of five years in prison; and violating the Export Control Reform Act, which carries a maximum statutory penalty of 20 years in prison. A federal district court judge will determine any sentence after considering the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and other statutory factors.Sue J. Bai, head of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, Assistant Director Roman Rozhavsky of the FBI’s Counterintelligence Division, and Special Agent in Charge Aaron Tambrini of the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) Chicago Field Office, Office of Export Enforcement made the announcement.Homeland Security Investigations Minneapolis, the FBI Minneapolis Field Office, and the Department of Commerce’s BIS Chicago Field Office are investigating the case.&nbsp;Assistant U.S. Attorney Bradley Endicott for the District of Minnesota and Trial Attorney Nicholas Hunter of the National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section are prosecuting the case. They received assistance from Assistant U.S. Attorney Michelle Jensen from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington and the Department’s Office of International Affairs.An indictment is merely an allegation. All defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Diopsys Inc., a medical device company based in Middletown, Pennsylvania, has agreed to pay up to $14.25 million to resolve allegations that the company violated the federal False Claims Act and various state laws by knowingly submitting or causing others to submit false claims for payment to Medicare and Medicaid in connection with certain vision testing services.The settlement resolves allegations relating to Diopsys’ NOVA device, an electrophysiological device that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared for visual evoked potential (VEP) testing.&nbsp;The United States alleged that, during the period from Jan. 1, 2015 through Dec. 31, 2021, Diopsys caused healthcare providers to submit false claims to Medicare and Medicaid for services in which the NOVA device was utilized for medically unnecessary uses, specifically electroretinography (ERG) vision testing, a substantially different vision test for which the NOVA device lacked FDA clearance.&nbsp;The government further contended that Diopsys made substantial changes to the NOVA device that it never submitted to FDA for clearance or approval despite knowing that such a submission was required.“Today’s resolution reaffirms our commitment to protect the integrity of the Medicare and Medicaid programs,” said U.S. Attorney John Giordano for the District of New Jersey. “Health care companies must not encourage doctors to submit claims for payment for medically unnecessary tests.”Under the terms of the settlement, Diopsys will make guaranteed payments of $1,225,000 and contingent payments of up to $13,025,000. The settlement is based on Diopsys’ financial condition.The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the&nbsp;qui tam&nbsp;or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Dr. Atul Jain, a California ophthalmologist. Under those provisions, a private party can file an action on behalf of the United States and receive a portion of any recovery.&nbsp; Approximately $1,120,000 of the guaranteed payment and up to approximately $11,900,000 of the contingent payments constitute the federal portion of the recovery.

Transnational Criminal Organizations used the location data derived from these tracking devices to direct vessels filled with cocaine bound for the United States around Colombian Navy ships and patrols.“This foreign national committed serious crimes to enable the flow of drugs into our country,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “This sentencing reflects the Department of Justice’s ironclad commitment to not only hunting down criminals, but ensuring that they suffer severe legal consequences following their apprehension.”“Our teams focus on sophisticated and violent drug trafficking organizations and work countless investigative hours,” said Special Agent in Charge Deanne L. Reuter of the Drug Enforcement Administration Miami Field Division. “I am proud of our team’s efforts and thankful for our law enforcement partners who brought this case to conclusion.”Assistant U.S. Attorney Lauren Stoia for the Middle District of Florida prosecuted this case.The Department of Justice’s Office of International Affairs and the Criminal Division’s Narcotic and Dangerous Drug Section’s Office of the Judicial Attaché in Bogotá, Colombia, provided significant assistance.This prosecution is part of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) Strike Force Initiative, which provides for the establishment of permanent multi-agency task force teams that work side-by-side in the same location. This co-located model enables agents from different agencies to collaborate on intelligence-driven, multi- jurisdictional operations to disrupt and dismantle the most significant drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs, and transnational criminal organizations.The specific mission of the OCDETF Panama Express Strike Force is to disrupt and dismantle Transnational Criminal Organizations involved in large-scale drug trafficking, money laundering, and related activities. The OCDETF Panama Express Strike Force is comprised of agents and officers from the Coast Guard Investigative Service, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI, and Homeland Security Investigations #> 6 LAREDO, Texas – A former Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer has been sentenced to federal prison in two separate cases for allowing aliens and cocaine across the border, announced U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.Emanuel Isac Celedon, 37, Laredo, pleaded guilty March 11, 2024, for his role in illegally smuggling illegal aliens into the United States through the Lincoln Juarez Port of Entry (POE) in Laredo. He also admitted to bribery and attempted importation of cocaine for accepting money to allow what he thought was cocaine to cross into the United States from Mexico.&nbsp;U.S. District Judge Diana Saldana has now imposed a total of&nbsp;117 months in prison&nbsp;for both cases to be immediately followed by&nbsp;four years of supervised release. He was also ordered to pay a money judgment of $17,980. At the hearing, the court noted&nbsp;Celedon’s job was to protect the United States from introduction of controlled substances and people not authorized to be in the country, and that he had failed in both regards. Judge Saldana added that Celedon was deeply involved in the organization and appeared to want to go even deeper.“Anybody who aids or works for the cartel is going to find themselves on the wrong end of a federal indictment,” said Ganjei. “This case was especially troubling given the position of trust the defendant held. His criminal conduct stands in stark contrast to the heroic work the men and women of CBP are doing every day to keep our border and ports secure.”While employed as a CBP Officer in Laredo in 2023, Celedon sought contacts within the Mexican criminal organization known as the Cartel del Noreste in order to smuggle drugs and aliens through his inspection lane in exchange for monetary payment.During an undercover operation, Celedon expressed his interest in smuggling cocaine for payment, provided his duty schedule and gave instructions directing a loaded vehicle to his inspection lane at the port of entry. He then allowed the vehicle to safely cross into the United States.&nbsp;Using his position as a CBP officer, Celedon allowed several kilograms of what he believed to be cocaine into the United States on two separate occasions in October 2023. In exchange, he received $6,000.Further investigation revealed Celedon also conspired with at least three others to bring illegal aliens into the United States without inspection. Celedon provided his daily lane assignment to Mexican national Homero Romero-Hernandez, 32, who passed the information to Jose Osvaldo Zapata-Vasquez, 25, another Mexican national with ties to the cartel. Zapata-Vasquez hired Cotulla resident Beatris Guadalupe Martinez, 22, to act as the driver.Zapata-Vasquez relayed instructions to Martinez based on information Celadon provided regarding when to pick up the aliens in Mexico and which lane to approach when making entry to the United States.The investigation revealed Martinez transported people through Celedon’s lane on at least nine separate occasions between September and November 2023. Each time, Celedon permitted entry without inspecting any of Martinez’s passengers. Additionally, on at least two of those dates, Celedon falsely inputted information into a CBP database in order to avoid sending Martinez to a mandatory secondary inspection.Celedon then asked Zapata-Vasquez and Romero-Hernandez to relay this to smugglers in Mexico in order to reassure them that he was doing his part to facilitate the cartel’s smuggling efforts. Law enforcement seized $1,980 in cash from Celedon at the time of his arrest, which he admitted were proceeds from human smuggling.Judge Saldana previously sentenced Zapata-Vasquez, Romero-Hernandez and Martinez to 46, 36, and 42 months in prison, respectively.Celedon has been and will remain in custody pending transfer to a U.S. Bureau of Prisons facility to be determined in the near future.The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) - Office of Inspector General, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland Security Investigations (ICE-HSI) and CBP - Office of Professional Responsibility conducted the investigation with assistance from the HSI Human Smuggling Unit in Washington, D.C., CBP’s National Targeting Center International Interdiction Task Force, Texas Department of Public Safety, Border Patrol, Webb County Precinct 2 Constable’s Office and CBP Laredo Joint Forensic Center.The case is the result of an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) operation and coordinated efforts of Joint Task Force Alpha (JTFA).OCDETF identifies, disrupts and dismantles the highest-level criminal organizations that threaten the United States using a prosecutor-led, intelligence-driven, multi-agency approach.JTFA, a partnership with DHS, has been elevated and expanded with a mandate to target cartels and transnational criminal organizations to eliminate human smuggling and trafficking networks operating in Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama and Colombia that impact public safety and the security of our borders. JTFA currently comprises detailees from U.S. Attorneys’ Offices along the southwest border, including the Southern District of California, District of Arizona, District of New Mexico and Western and Southern Districts of Texas. Dedicated support is provided by the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, led by the Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section and supported by the Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, Office of Enforcement Operations and the Office of International Affairs, among others. JTFA also relies on substantial law enforcement investment from DHS, FBI, DEA and other partners. To date, JTFA’s work has resulted in more than 355 domestic and international arrests of leaders, organizers and significant facilitators of alien smuggling, more than 320 U.S. convictions, more than 265 significant jail sentences imposed and forfeitures of substantial assets.This case is also part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to repel the invasion of illegal immigration, achieve the total elimination of cartels and transnational criminal organizations and protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the&nbsp;Department’s OCDETF and&nbsp;Project Safe Neighborhood.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jennifer Day and Arthur R. Jones prosecuted the cases.&nbsp;&nbsp; #>   changed created       date number #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2025-03-28 25-092 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2025-03-28 25-317 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2025-03-28 25-319 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2025-03-28 25-091 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2025-03-28   <NA> #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2025-03-28   <NA> #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            teaser #> 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               John Giordano announced today that he will be stepping down as U.S. Attorney for his new role as U.S. Ambassador. #> 2                                                                                                                                           An indictment was unsealed yesterday charging Mohammad Jawaid Aziz, also known as Jawaid Aziz Siddiqui and Jay Siddiqui, 67, of Pakistan and Canada with conspiracy to violate U.S. export laws and violating U.S. export laws.&nbsp; #> 3 Diopsys Inc., a medical device company based in Middletown, Pennsylvania, has agreed to pay up to $14.25 million to resolve allegations that the company violated the federal False Claims Act and various state laws by knowingly submitting or causing others to submit false claims for payment to Medicare and Medicaid in connection with certain vision testing services. #> 4                                                                                                                                           A federal grand jury in the District of New Jersey returned a two-count indictment against a New Jersey man for falsely stating on an application for naturalization that he had never been associated with a terrorist organization. #> 5                                       Tampa, FL — On Wednesday, Cesar Augusto Romero Caballero, of Colombia, was sentenced to 15 years in prison by U.S. District Court Judge James Moody Jr. for conspiracy to distribute cocaine having reasonable cause to believe it would be unlawfully imported into the United States.

Co. Ltd. and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. have agreed to plead guilty and serve jail time in the United States for participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) panels, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today.      According to a one-count felony charge filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chang Suk \"C.S.\" Chung, a Korean LG executive, conspired with unnamed employees from other panel makers to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels from on or about Sept. 21, 2001, to on or about June 1, 2006. According to a separate one-count felony charge, also filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chieng-Hon \"Frank\" Lin, a Taiwanese former executive from Chunghwa, and Chih-Chun \"C.C.\" Liu and Hsueh-Lung \"Brian\" Lee, Taiwanese current employees of Chungwha, are charged with participating in the same conspiracy at various times during the period from Sept. 14, 2001, to on or about Dec. 1, 2006.      Under the plea agreements, which must be approved by the court, all four executives have agreed to serve a term of imprisonment, pay a criminal fine and assist the government in its ongoing TFT-LCD investigation.      TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. In 2006, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was approximately $70 billion.      \"These cases involve the first Taiwanese nationals to face imprisonment in the United States for an antitrust offense,\" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department of Justice is committed to holding accountable all conspirators who harm American consumers, no matter where they live or where they commit the crime.\"      During the conspiracy, Chang Suk Chung, a Korean citizen, worked as LG’s Vice President of Monitor Sales. Under the plea agreement, Chung has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $25,000 criminal fine.      During the charged conspiracy period, Chieng-Hon Lin, a Taiwanese and U.S. citizen, was Chunghwa’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Under the plea agreement, Lin has agreed to serve a nine-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $50,000 criminal fine.      Chih-Chun Liu, a Taiwanese citizen, was Chunghwa’s Vice President of LCD Sales during the charged conspiracy period. Under the plea agreement, Liu has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $30,000 criminal fine.      Hsueh-Lung Lee, a Taiwanese citizen, held various sales positions at Chunghwa during the charged conspiracy period, including Vice President of LCD Sales. Under the plea agreement, Lee has agreed to serve a six-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $20,000 criminal fine.      These four foreign-based executives were charged with participating with co-conspirators in a conspiracy that was accomplished by:    Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT-LCD panels;  Agreeing during these meetings, conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT-LCD panels at certain predetermined levels;  Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached;  Exchanging information on sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices; and  Authorizing, ordering and consenting to the participation of subordinate employees in the conspiracy.        \"These are the first individuals to plead guilty to a charge of fixing prices in this active investigation into antitrust violations in the TFT-LCD industry,\" said Scott D. Hammond, the Antitrust Division’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement. \"We will continue in our efforts to bring to justice other domestic and foreign-based executives who were involved with fixing TFT-LCD prices.\"      On Dec. 15, 2008, LG pleaded guilty to participating in this conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $400 million criminal fine – the second largest fine in Antitrust Division history. On Jan. 14, 2009, Chunghwa pleaded guilty to participating in the same conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $65 million criminal fine.      On Dec. 16, 2008, Sharp Corp. pleaded guilty to three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels sold to Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc., and was sentenced to pay a $120 million criminal fine.      The four executives are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of $1 million and up to 10 years in prison for an individual. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.      These pleas are the result of a joint investigation by the Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Field Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Francisco.      Anyone with information concerning illegal conduct in the TFT-LCD industry is urged to call the San Francisco Field Office of the Antitrust Division at 415-436-6660. #> 2 American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company today agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.415 billion for promoting its drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice announced today. This resolution includes a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a United States criminal prosecution of any kind. Eli Lilly will also pay up to $800 million in a civil settlement with the federal government and the states.Eli Lilly agreed to enter a global resolution with the United States to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it promoted its antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA, the Department said. Such unapproved uses are also known as \"off-label\" uses because they are not included in the drug’s FDA approved product label.Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Gregory G. Katsas and acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Laurie Magid today announced the filing of a criminal information against Eli Lilly for promoting Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA. Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, is charged in the information with promoting Zyprexa for such off-label or unapproved uses as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, in elderly people.The company has signed a plea agreement admitting its guilt to a misdemeanor criminal charge. Eli Lilly also signed a civil settlement to resolve civil claims that by marketing Zyprexa for unapproved uses, it caused false claims for payment to be submitted to federal insurance programs such as Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, none of which provided coverage for such off-label uses.The plea agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay a criminal fine of $515 million and forfeit assets of $100 million. The civil settlement agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay up to an additional $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve civil allegations originally brought in four separate lawsuits under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act. The federal share of the civil settlement amount is $438 million. Under the terms of the civil settlement, Eli Lilly will pay up to $361 million to those states that opt to participate in the agreement.Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a company must specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to the FDA. Before approving a drug, the FDA must determine that the drug is safe and effective for the use proposed by the company. Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for off-label uses.The FDA originally approved Zyprexa, also known by the chemical name olanzapine, in Sept. 1996 for the treatment of manifestations of psychotic disorders. In March 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. In Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short term treatment of schizophrenia in place of the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders. Also in Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable for approximately eight weeks and were then followed for a period of up to eight months. Zyprexa has never been approved for the treatment of dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia.The criminal information, filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that from Sept. 1999 through at least Nov. 2003, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for the treatment of agitation, aggression, hostility, dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression and generalized sleep disorder. The information alleges that Eli Lilly’s management created marketing materials promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, trained its sales force to disregard the law and directed its sales personnel to promote Zyprexa for off-label uses.The information alleges that beginning in 1999, Eli Lilly expended significant resources to promote Zyprexa in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, primarily through its long-term care sales force. Eli Lilly sought to convince doctors to prescribe Zyprexa to treat patients with disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and behavioral symptoms such as agitation, aggression, and hostility.The information further alleges that the FDA never approved Zyprexa for the treatment of dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, or the cognitive deficits associated with dementia.The information also alleges that building on its unlawful promotion and success in the long-term care market, Eli Lilly executives decided to market Zyprexa to primary-care physicians. In Oct. 2000, Eli Lilly began this off-label marketing campaign targeting primary care physicians, even though the company knew that there was virtually no approved use for Zyprexa in the primary-care market. Eli Lilly trained its primary-care physician sales representatives to promote Zyprexa by focusing on symptoms, rather than Zyprexa’s FDA approved indications.The qui tam lawsuits alleged that between Sept. 1999 and the end of 2005, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for use in patients of all ages and for the treatment of anxiety, irritability, depression, nausea, Alzheimer’s and other mood disorders. The qui tam lawsuits also alleged that the company funded continuing medical education programs, through millions of dollars in grants, to promote off-label uses of its drugs, in violation of the FDA’s requirements.\"Off-label promotion of pharmaceutical drugs is a serious crime because it undermines the FDA’s role in protecting the American public by determining that a drug is safe and effective for a particular use before it is marketed,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. \"This settlement demonstrates the Department’s ongoing diligence in prosecuting cases involving violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and recovering taxpayer dollars used to pay for drugs sold as a result of off-label marketing campaigns.\"\"When pharmaceutical companies ignore the government’s process for protecting the public, they undermine the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship and place innocent people in harm’s way,\" said acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Laurie Magid. \"Off-label marketing created unnecessary risks for patients. People have an absolute right to their doctor’s medical expertise, and to know that their health care provider’s judgment has not be clouded by misinformation from a company trying to build its bottom line.\"The global resolution includes the following agreements:\\tA plea agreement signed by Eli Lilly admitting guilt to the criminal charge of misbranding. Specifically, Eli Lilly admits that between Sept. 1999 and March 31, 2001, the company promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. Eli Lilly has agreed to pay a $515 million criminal fine and to forfeit an additional $100 million in assets.\\tA civil settlement between Eli Lilly, the United States and various States, in which Eli Lilly will pay up to $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve False Claims Act claims and related state claims by Medicaid and other federal programs and agencies including TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Department of Veterans Affairs, Bureau of Prisons and the Public Health Service Entities. The federal government will receive $438,171,544 from the civil settlement. The state Medicaid programs and the District of Columbia will share up to $361,828,456 of the civil settlement, depending on the number of states that participate in the settlement.\\tThe qui tam relators will receive $78,870,877 from the federal share of the settlement amount.\\tA Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) between Eli Lilly and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that a Board of Directors committee annually review the company’s compliance program and certify its effectiveness; that certain managers annually certify that their departments or functional areas are compliant; that Eli Lilly send doctors a letter notifying them about the global settlement; and that the company post on its website information about payments to doctors, such as honoraria, travel or lodging. Eli Lilly is subject to exclusion from Federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches.\"OIG’s Corporate Integrity Agreement will increase the transparency of Eli Lilly’s interactions with physicians and strengthen Eli Lilly’s accountability for its compliance with the law,\" said Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson. \"This historic resolution demonstrates the Government’s commitment to improvethe integrity of drug promotion activities.\"In addition to the $1.415 billion criminal and civil settlement announced today, Eli Lilly previously agreed to pay $62 million to settle consumer protection lawsuits brought by 33 states. The state consumer protection settlements were announced on Oct. 7, 2008.\"Today's announcement of the filing of a criminal charge and the unprecedented terms of this settlement demonstrates the government's increasing efforts aimed at pharmaceutical companies that choose to put profits ahead of the public's health,\" said Special Agent-in-Charge Kim Rice of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations. \"The FDA will continue to devote resources to criminal investigations targeting pharmaceutical companies that disregard the safeguards of the drug approval process and recklessly promote drugs for uses for which they have not been proven to be safe and effective.\"\"The illegal scheme used by Eli Lilly significantly impacted the integrity of TRICARE, the Department of Defense's healthcare system,\" said Ed Bradley, Special Agent-in-Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service. \"This illegal activity increases patients’ costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the over nine million military members, retirees and their families who rely on this system. Today’s charges and settlement demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its partners in law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those that abuse the government's healthcare programs at the expense of the taxpayers and patients.\"\"This case should serve as still another warning to all those who break the law in order to improve their profits,\" said Patrick Doyle, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services in Philadelphia. &nbsp;\"OIG, working with our law enforcement partners, will pursue and bring to justice those who would steal from vulnerable beneficiaries and the taxpayers.\"The civil settlement resolves four qui tam actions filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania: United States ex rel. Rudolf, et al., v. Eli Lilly and Company, Civil Action No. 03-943 (E.D. Pa.); United States ex rel. Faltaous v. Eli Lilly and Company, Civil Action No. 06-2909 (E.D. Pa.); United States ex rel. Woodward v. Dr. George B. Jerusalem, et al., Civil Action No. 06-5526 (E.D. Pa.); and United States ex rel. Vicente v. Eli Lilly and Company, Civil Action No. 07-1791 (E.D. Pa.). All of those cases were filed by former Eli Lilly sales representatives.The criminal case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Office of Consumer Litigation of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. The civil settlement was reached by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.This matter was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.Assistance was provided by representatives of FDA’s Office of Chief Counsel and the National Association of Medicaid Fraud Control Units.The Corporate Integrity Agreement was negotiated by the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services.Eli Lilly's guilty plea and sentence is not final until accepted by the U.S. District Court. #> 3

                                                                                                              WASHINGTON—In the largest settlement yet in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ongoing cement kiln enforcement initiative, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, today lodged a consent decree with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California resolving Clean Air Act claims against CEMEX California Cement LLC with respect to the company’s Victorville, Calif., Portland cement plant.The settlement will resolve claims asserted in a 2007 complaint that CEMEX is releasing pollutants to the air, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, without required permits setting emission limits under the Clean Air Act.&nbsp; Under the terms of the settlement, CEMEX must meet new limits for these pollutants at the Victorville plant, one of the largest cement plants in the United States, including stringent new limits for nitrogen oxide that will reduce emissions by 1,890 tons per year, a nearly 40 percent reduction.&nbsp; The cement manufacturer must also pay a $2 million civil penalty.&nbsp; EPA estimates that achieving and maintaining compliance with the new emission limits, depending on the control technology used, could cost CEMEX millions of dollars.“Today’s settlement shows the federal government’s continued commitment to enforcing the federal environmental laws and protecting the nation’s air quality,” said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.“This settlement will result in cleaner air for California,” said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA’s Air Division in the Pacific Southwest region.&nbsp; “This facility is the largest source of nitrogen oxide—an air pollutant that causes smog—in California, so the state-of-the-art air pollution controls that CEMEX is installing will have a significant impact on air quality.”The settlement resolves the EPA’s claims that on two separate occasions, in 1997 and 2000, CEMEX violated the Clean Air Act by undertaking major plant modifications resulting in significant increases in the Victorville plant’s capacity to pollute without first undergoing required regulatory review or obtaining required permits under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, program and without installing state-of-the-art emission controls that would reduce contaminants such as nitrogen oxide.&nbsp;Nitrogen oxide is a harmful air pollutant that causes smog and leads to respiratory problems in children and the elderly.&nbsp; The Victorville area fails to meet federal air quality standards for both ozone and particulate matter.The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.&nbsp; A copy of the

of Review, which upholds the constitutionality of foreign intelligence surveillance conducted under the Protect America Act of 2007.      \"The case involved a challenge by a private party to directives that were issued under the Protect America Act and that required the party to assist the Government in conducting foreign intelligence surveillance against targets reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. The Court of Review upheld the lawfulness of the directives, concluding that the surveillance at issue fell within the foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement and was otherwise reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.      \"The Court issued a classified version of its opinion in August 2008 and subsequently requested publication of an unclassified version. Today, after a careful classification review process, the Court published the unclassified version of its opinion. The Court of Review's decision marks the second ruling published by the Court since it was established more than 30 years ago.\" #> 5

the conditions of confinement at the King County Correctional Facility in Seattle. The agreement follows the Department’s investigation of the facility, which found substantial civil rights violations.      \"I appreciate King County’s cooperation during our investigation and commend the leadership of the King County Executive and the County Council for their commitment to improve conditions at the jail,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"Today’s agreement will ensure that necessary measures are taken so that the County will meet its obligations under the law.\"      The Department’s investigation identified inadequate medical care and contagious disease prevention and treatment services, inadequate security and detention practices, and inadequate suicide prevention procedures. The agreement requires the implementation of measures to ensure that the identified deficiencies are remedied and that the services and systems to address the inadequate conditions are consistent with constitutional standards.      The Civil Rights Division conducted its investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which authorizes the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations of other adult correctional facilities in numerous other jurisdictions, including Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.      The Department of Justice’s enforcement effort reaches beyond adult correctional facilities. Since 2001, the Department of Justice has opened 97 similar investigations into conditions of confinement at correctional facilities, juvenile detention centers, nursing homes, mental health facilities and residences for persons with developmental disabilities throughout the United States.

                                 WASHINGTON – The owners and operators of two Miami medical clinics, along with a phlebotomist at one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced today.            Juan A. \"Tony\" Marrero, 41, Belkis Marrero, 41, and Luz Borrego, 43, each pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2009, to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in the Southern District of Florida. In their pleas, Tony and Belkis Marrero admitted that they co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;P).      Medcore and M&amp;P purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. The Marreros admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 they conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Borrego acknowledged her role in the fraud at Medcore where she was a phlebotomist who administered unnecessary drugs intravenously to HIV patients. Tony Marrero also pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracies to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud. Sentencing for all three defendants is scheduled for April 3, 2009.      During their pleas, the defendants admitted that Medcore and M&amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare and that the treatments for infused or injected drugs billed to Medicare were not medically necessary. Each of the defendants also admitted that all of the patients at the clinics were participants in the fraud. The defendants admitted that they, or their co-conspirators, entered into kickback arrangements with these Medicare beneficiaries whereby the beneficiaries were paid every week in exchange for their Medicare billing information, which allowed the clinics to submit the fraudulent bills.      To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Tony Marrero admitted that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.      The defendants admitted that none of the Medicare beneficiaries needed the injection and infusion treatments billed to Medicare by the clinics. Tony and Belkis Marrero acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Belkis Marrero and Borrego also admitted that they put together medical files to make them appear legitimate and that they supported the treatments being billed to Medicare.      On Jan. 7, 2009, Orlando Pascual Jr., a co-owner of Medcore and M&amp;P, pleaded guilty to his role in the Medicare fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a separate durable medical equipment company that he operated from 2001 to 2003.      On Jan. 14, 2009, Harold Sio, the owner of pharmaceutical wholesale company named Lifecare Medical, was charged by criminal information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sio, whose company supplied Medcore and M&amp;P with infusible drugs, allegedly conspired with Pascual and Tony Marrero to accomplish the health care fraud scheme by providing false invoices for the drugs allegedly used in the scheme.      Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 9, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment and an information are merely charges, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.      The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S. (Jay) Darden, and Trial Attorney Charles Reed of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General and the FBI. The case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (MFSF), supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and U.S. Attorney Acosta of the Southern District of Florida. Since the inception of MFSF operations, federal prosecutors have indicted 106 cases with 190 defendants in both Los Angeles and Miami. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for more than half a billion dollars. #>   changed created       date number #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-046 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-038 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-044 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-040 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-047 #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-042 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      teaser #> 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Executives from LG Display Co.
