Visionary Bowling Products, et al.No. 4:24-CR-00418 (Eastern District of Missouri)AUSA Dianna CollinsOn October 2, 2024, prosecutors charged Visionary Bowling Products (VBP), and company owners, John Wonders, Sr., and Jason Wonders, with violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for illegally storing hazardous waste (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(2)(A)).VBP operated a 60,000 square-foot factory, which it used to manufacture bowling balls for approximately 20 years before ceasing operations in July 2019.When the defendants abandoned the property in October 2019, they left behind a variety of chemicals and industrial materials. On October 21, 2021, a fire ignited and burned for approximately 12 hours, requiring multiple fire departments to respond. Officials ordered the evacuation of nearby homes and businesses due to the potential hazard posed by the burning chemicals. The following day, a smaller fire rekindled but was quickly extinguished.Local environmental officials later discovered hundreds of discarded and abandoned containers at the facility in various stages of deterioration. Testing by federal environmental officials confirmed that the defendants had illegally stored hazardous waste at the site.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division and Missouri Department of Natural Resources conducted the investigation.

Andres Alejandro SanchezNo. 24-CR-1264 (Southern District of Texas)AUSA Tory SailerAssistance from ECS Senior Counsel Elinor ColbournOn October 29, 2024, prosecutors charged Andres Alejandro Sanchez with smuggling, conspiracy, and violating the Lacey Act for smuggling spider monkeys into the United States (18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 545; 16 U. S.C. §§ 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(2)).On October 7, 2024, Sanchez travelled from Mexico to Laredo, Texas, and failed to declare a spider monkey he had in his vehicle to Customs and Border Patrol officers as he attempted to cross the border.The U.S. Customs and Border Control, Homeland Security Investigations, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation.&nbsp;Guilty PleasUnited States v. Frock Brothers Trucking, Inc., et al.No. 1:24-CR-00250 (Middle District of Pennsylvania)AUSA William BeheOn October 1, 2024, Frock Brothers Trucking, Inc. (Frock), pleaded guilty to conspiracy and violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) for tampering with the emission control systems of several of their heavy-duty fleet trucks. The company admitted to disabling emission controls in violation of the CAA (18 U.S.C. § 371 and 42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(2)(C)). The company is set for sentencing on January 9, 2025.Frock, a long-distance trucking company based in New Oxford, Pennsylvania, transports a variety of goods, including snack foods, refrigerated items, and produce. Ed Frock owned the company until his death in August 2022.Between November 13, 2018, and December 28, 2018, Frock contracted with co-defendant Leon Martin, a mechanic who operated out of his home, to disable and/or remove emission control components from eight of their diesel trucks. Martin also tampered with the required onboard diagnostic equipment (OBD) to delete factory-installed emission controls from Frock's heavy duty diesel trucks. Martin's tunes enabled those deleted trucks to operate without emission control devices as required by federal law.Martin pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act. He is scheduled for sentencing on January 7, 2025.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.&nbsp;United States v. Jose V. FernandezNo. 1:24-CR-00071 (District of Rhode Island)AUSA John McAdamsOn October 2, 2024, Jose V. Fernandez pleaded guilty to making false statements for distributing false asbestos abatement training certifications (18 U.S.C. § 1001 (a)(3)). Sentencing is scheduled for January 7, 2025.Fernandez owned the Rhode Island Safety Environment Training Center (RISE). The Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDH) accredited the facility to provide asbestos abatement training. On multiple occasions between 2021 and 2023, Fernandez submitted false documentation to the RIDH attesting that nearly two dozen individuals paid for, attended, and successfully completed an Environmental Protection Agency-approved abatement training program when, in fact, no one attended any classes.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division and the Rhode Island Department of Health conducted the investigation.United States v. Redemption Repairs &amp; PerformanceNo. 4:24-CR-40016 (Western District of Arkansas)AUSA Sydney StanleyOn October 2, 2024, Redemption Repairs &amp; Performance (RRP) pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) for modifying and deleting the emissions control systems of diesel engines and tampering with and rendering inaccurate the vehicles’ onboard diagnostic systems (OBD) (42 U.S.C&nbsp;§ 7413(c)(2)(C)).RRP is a truck repair shop specializing in diesel engine repairs and performance located in Texarkana, Arkansas. Between May 2020 and October 2022, the company falsified, tampered with, and rendered inaccurate monitoring devices required to be maintained and followed under the CAA. After removing or altering the emission control equipment on diesel trucks, RRP modified the diesel trucks’ OBD systems to prevent detection of the removal and disabling of the equipment. The company performed this service on close to 50 vehicles, charging between $2,600-$2,700 per truck.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.&nbsp;United States v. AM/NS Calvert LLCNo. 1:24-CR-00117 (Southern District of Alabama)ECS Senior Counsel Kris DigheAUSA Mike AndersonOn October 10, 2024, AM/NS Calvert LLC (AM/NS), a steel production facility, pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(2)(B)). In addition, the court also sentenced the company to pay a $750,000 fine and complete a three-year term of probation.AM/NS is a joint venture by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel operating in Calvert, Alabama. The company held a CAA permit issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), which required the treatment of certain air emissions for chlorine.&nbsp;In 2015, AM/NS determined it could not meet emissions limits using water and switched to a caustic solution with ADEM's approval.In early 2017, AM/NS went back to using water since the caustic solution was damaging the pipes, necessitating extensive repairs. In August 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and ADEM conducted a joint inspection of the AM/NS Calvert acid regeneration plant. During the inspection, they found that the facility was not using the caustic solution, violating the permit. Further investigation revealed the AM/NS Calvert acid regeneration plant had not used caustic solution for approximately 700 days over a two-year period.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.United States v. Wan Yee NgNo. 2:24-CR-00084 (District of Vermont)AUSA Thomas AlibertiECS Senior Counsel Elinor ColbournOn October 11, 2024,&nbsp;Chinese national Wan Yee Ng pleaded guilty to attempting to smuggle eastern box turtles, a protected species, from the United States to Canada (18 U.S.C. § 554).&nbsp;Sentencing is scheduled for December 13, 2024.U.S. Border Patrol agents began surveilling Ng during the spring of 2024, after she rented lodging from a facility near the Canadian border known for illegal smuggling activities.On June 26, 2024, agents observed Ng carrying a duffel bag as she prepared an inflatable kayak on the shore of Lake Wallace. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police notified those agents that two individuals (one believed to be Ng’s spouse) had launched an inflatable watercraft on the Canadian side of the lake and begun paddling southward, toward the United States. Before she could leave the shore, agents intercepted Ng and detained her for suspected smuggling activity.Agents found 29 turtles individually wrapped in socks inside her duffle bag. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife agent preliminarily identified them as eastern box turtles. The pet trade market, especially in China and Hong Kong, highly prizes turtles with colorful markings. These animals are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).The U.S. Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted the investigation with assistance from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Related Press Release: District of Vermont | Woman Charged with Attempted Smuggling of Protected Turtles | United States Department of JusticeUnited States v. Robert G. GambillNo. 5:24-CR-00028 (Western District of North Carolina)AUSA Katherine T. ArmstrongOn October 11, 2024, Robert G. Gambill pleaded guilty to violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act for killing a bald eagle (16 U.S.C. § 668(a)).On June 5, 2024, Gambill shot and killed a bald eagle that was perched in a tree near a bridge in Sparta, North Carolina. After killing the eagle, Gambill drove away from the scene, abandoning the carcass on the bank of the New River. Two witnesses recovered the carcass and turned it over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The U.S. FWS forensic laboratory determined that injuries suffered by the bald eagle were consistent with a gunshot wound from a high-powered rifle.The plea agreement requires Gambill to forfeit his Ruger M77 Mark 2 22-250 rifle and Nikon Monarch MR31 4x16-42 scope.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation, with assistance from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the Alleghany County Sheriff’s Office.United States v. Edwin FloresNo. 3:24-CR-00093 (Southern District of California)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Stephen DaPonteFormer AUSA Melanie PiersonOn October 17, 2024, Edwin Flores pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to failing to present merchandise for inspection by a customs officer (18 U.S.C. § 371). Sentencing is scheduled for January 9, 2025.On April 18, 2024, Flores drove a vehicle over the border from Mexico with three 30-pound cylinders of HCFC-22 that he failed to present for inspection.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division, Homeland Security Investigations, and Customs and Border Protection conducted the investigation.United States v. Keidrick D. Usifo, et al.No. 24-CR-00040 (Eastern District of Arkansas)AUSA Edward WalkerOn October 22, 2024, Keidrick Damond Usifo and Deon Johnson pleaded guilty to violating the Big Cat Public Safety Act (BCPSA)(16 U.S.C. §§ 3372 (e)(1)(A), 3373 (d)).Lawmakers enacted the&nbsp;BCPSA in December 2022 to protect the public by prohibiting the private ownership of big cats, such as tigers and lions, as pets and by prohibiting exhibitors from allowing public contact with big cats, including tiger cubs. This law places new restrictions on the commerce, breeding, possession, and use of certain big cat species.In April 2023, a citizen tipped off local game authorities after seeing a tiger cub in a residential neighborhood in Conway, Arkansas. Further investigation confirmed that Usifo purchased a tiger in March 2023 from a broker in Dallas, Texas, and brought it back to his residence in Arkansas.After a second complaint was filed about the tiger cub, law enforcement conducted a traffic stop on April 21, 2023, arresting Usifo on a felony state warrant. The Conway Police Department then executed a search warrant at Usifo’s residence. The animal was not there, but they found evidence of its presence, including the fact that rooms in the house matched those in photos of the tiger that Usifo posted on Instagram.While in the Pulaski County Detention Facility (PCDF), Usifo made several calls to Johnson. Johnson fed the tiger for Usifo while he was held in detention. Johnson concealed his knowledge of the tiger when questioned by agents.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation, with assistance from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the Conway Police Department, and the Little Rock Police Department.&nbsp;Related Press Release: Eastern District of Arkansas | Defendants Plead Guilty To Violation of The Big Cat Public Safety Act | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of tiger cub illegally purchased by defendant Usifo.United States v. Ryan Hugh Milliken, et al.No. 2:24-CR-00057 (Eastern District of Washington)AUSA Dan FruchterAUSA Jacob BrooksOn October 24, 2024, Ryan Hugh Milliken and his company, Hardaway Solutions, LLC (Hardaway), pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act (18 U.S.C. § 371; 42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(2)(C)). Sentencing is scheduled for January 22, 2025.Between August 2017 and November 2023, Milliken and Hardway created and sold illegal “delete tune” packages designed to disable and defeat required emissions controls and monitoring systems. Milliken and Hardway created and sold these delete tune files for various customers and vehicles, including numerous Spokane-based trucking companies. Pavel Ivanovich Turlak, and his companies--PT Express, LLC, Spokane Truck Service, LLC, and Pauls Trans, LLC--are scheduled for trial on January 27, 2025.Milliken created and sold custom software delete tunes to Turlak for vehicles based on specifications Turlak outlined. Turlak then charged as much as $3,500 to diesel truck owners to “delete” and “tune” their vehicles by tampering with their pollution monitoring devices. Turlak also fraudulently received more than $300,000 in federal funding designated for eligible small businesses during the pandemic. Charges against Turlak include wire fraud and false claims in connection with this fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 287).The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation with assistance from the EPA National Enforcement Investigations Center, the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, and the Spokane Police Department.United States v. Benjamin GathercoleNo. 3:24-CR-00098 (Eastern District of Virginia)AUSA Heather Hart MansfieldRCEC David LastraOn October 30, 2024, Benjamin Gathercole pleaded guilty to violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for illegally transporting hazardous waste without a manifest (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(5)).Gathercole lived in Tappahannock, Virginia, and worked at a brake manufacturing facility also located in Tappahannock. In 2019, a Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) inspector determined that the brake manufacturing facility failed to make an accurate waste determination for 32 55-gallon drums stored on site. Some of the drums displayed labels noting they contained hazardous waste, but not in accordance with RCRA requirements. The DEQ issued the facility a notice of violation in May 2019.In September and October 2019, Gathercole removed and transported 31 of the 55-gallon drums from the facility to his residence. He dug a near his property and buried the drums in the ground, crushing some of them during the process, and spilling their contents into the ground.In December 2020, a citizen tipped the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about the illegal burial. In November 2021, agents executed a search warrant on the defendant’s property. Gathercole admitted burying the drums at the request of his employer, directing authorities to the burial site. Further testing confirmed the defendant had buried ignitable hazardous waste. The EPA finished excavating the site in November 2022.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division and EPA National Enforcement Investigation Center conducted the investigation.SentencingsUnited States v. Michael MacartneyNo. 2:24-CR-00025 (Eastern District of Virginia)AUSA Elizabeth YusiOn October 1, 2024, a court sentenced Michael Macartney to 40 months’ incarceration, followed by three years’ supervised release, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to create and distribute animal crush videos (18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 48(a)(2),(a)(3)).Between November 2021 and August 2022, Macartney and co-conspirators administered a private online chat group, and participated on other private online chat groups, that used encrypted messaging to fund, view, and distribute videos depicting, among other things, the torture, murder, and sexually sadistic mutilation of animals, specifically, juvenile and adult monkeys. Macartney received more than 300 electronic payments related to this activity.In March 2022, Macartney agreed to sell copies of all his animal crush videos to a co-conspirator for $100. The co-conspirator sent Macartney $75 electronically and Macartney sent the co-conspirator website links to his stored videos. Macartney stated there were just under 2,300 videos.Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation.United States v. Raymond Anthony Rabago Montoya, et al.No. 2:23-CR-01305 (District of Arizona)AUSA Lisa JennisAUSA Stuart ZanderOn October 2, 2024, Raymond Anthony Rabago Montoya was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for his role in a conspiracy to traffic in protected wildlife. In addition, he was ordered to pay $3,000 to the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. This sentence follows a previous conviction for his mother, Griselda Guadalupe Montoya-Gastelum, who received an 18-month prison sentence, also with three years of supervised release. Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Lacey Act for trafficking in protected wildlife (18 U.S.C. § 371; 16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(1)B)).The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began investigating the defendants in August 2022 after receiving a report from a person who purchased four exotic parrots and believed Rabago Montoya had illegally imported the birds. Further investigation determined that the defendants illegally imported exotic and protected wildlife, including tigers, panthers, monkeys, and&nbsp;parrots, from Mexico into the United States.In January 2023, agents executed a search warrant at Carlos Castro’s home, where they found a tiger cub, an alligator, 12 snapping turtles, six tortoises, and boxes of other reptiles. Snapchat messages revealed that Montoya-Gastelum and Castro discussed illegal exotic animal sales and trades. A court in Maricopa County subsequently convicted Castro of Unlawful Sale of Wildlife in the Arizona Superior Court.In April and May of 2023, federal agents received information about spider monkeys being sold on Facebook. They arranged two undercover purchases of the monkeys from the defendants, paying $6,000 each. In June and August 2023, agents arrested Rabago Montoya with dozens of endangered parrots concealed in his vehicle, many of them deceased.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Homeland Security Investigations; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the U.S. Border Patrol, and the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office conducted the investigation.&nbsp;Related Press Release: &nbsp;District of Arizona | Mother and Son Sentenced for Illegally Importing Endangered Wildlife | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of spider monkey smuggled by defendants.United States v.

Bedra pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to violating the Animal Crush statute for collaborating with others to create and distribute videos depicting acts of extreme violence and abuse against monkeys (18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 48(a)(3)).The conspirators used encrypted chat apps to direct money to individuals in Indonesia willing to commit the requested acts of torture on camera. Bedra also mailed a thumb drive containing 64 videos of monkey torture to a co-conspirator in Wisconsin.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the investigation.&nbsp;United States v. Brian Tibbets, et al.Nos. 4:21-CR-00218, 4:22-CR-00282 (District of Idaho)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Cassie BarnumAUSA Francis ZebariECS Law Clerk Amanda BackerOn October 22, 2024, a court sentenced Brian Tibbets to pay a $40,000 fine and complete a five-year term of probation, to include six months’ home confinement. Tibbetts also will perform 1,000 hours of community service. Tibbets pleaded guilty to obstructing a pending proceeding related to a demolition project (18 U.S.C. § 1505). Co-defendant Brek Pilling was sentenced in August 2024 to pay a $100,000 fine, and complete a five-year term of probation, to include three months of home confinement. He also will perform 100 hours of community service. Pilling pleaded guilty to a Clean Air Act negligent endangerment count (42 U.S.C. § 7413).In late 2017, Pilling and Tibbets purchased two buildings in Burley, Idaho, planning to demolish them and build a parking lot. During a walkthrough with city officials, the building inspector pointed out likely asbestos-containing material (ACM). In further communications with the city, other city employees warned the owners about the presence of ACM requiring remediation. The owners took “samples” from the buildings that included wood, brick, and stone (but no building materials that could plausibly be composed of ACM) and submitted those to a forensic lab for analysis.In January 2018, both buildings caught fire under suspicious circumstances. After seeing the fire on the news, a local contractor contacted the defendants and offered to demolish what remained of the buildings using his own asbestos inspector and remediation company. The owners accepted the contractor’s bid but said they would hire their own remediation company. Two days later, the contractor saw the buildings under demolition. The defendants chose to hire an individual to knock them down without conducting any asbestos abatement. During the demolition, individuals hauled several truckloads of debris to a nearby landfill. The owners also lied to an inspector during a subsequent conversation about onsite testing.The National Enforcement Investigation Center analyzed samples taken from the sites and found multiple areas with ACM. Officials ultimately removed approximately 860 tons of asbestos-contaminated demolition debris from the site, at a cost of approximately $845,000.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.United States v. Kyle Potter, et al.No. 3:24-CR-00047 (District of Alaska)AUSA Seth BrickeyOn October 22, 2024, a court sentenced Kyle Potter to pay a $20,000 fine and complete a five-year term of probation. Co-defendant Justin Welch was sentenced on October 1, 2024, to pay a $10,000 fine and complete a three-year term of probation. A restitution hearing is scheduled for December 10, 2024. Potter and Welch pleaded guilty to violating the Lacey Act for their roles in illegally transporting crab from Alaska (16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(2)(A), 3373(d)(1)(B)). Corey Potter is set for a status conference on December 11, 2024.Corey Potter owns two crab catching vessels; Kyle Potter and Welch worked as vessel captains. In February and March 2024, the vessels harvested more than 7,000 pounds of Tanner and Golden king crab in Southeast Alaska. Corey Potter directed Welch and Kyle Potter to take the crab to Seattle, Washington, where they intended to sell it at a higher price than they would have in Alaska. Neither captain landed the harvested crab at a port in Alaska, and they never recorded the harvest on a fish ticket, as required under state law.A large portion of the king crab that arrived in Seattle from Alaska had died and was unmarketable. Corey Potter knew that some of the crab aboard was infected with Bitter Crab Syndrome (BCS), a parasitic disease fatal to crustaceans. Officials were forced to destroy more than 4,000 additional pounds of Tanner crab due to the risk of BCS infection. If the defendants had properly landed the crab in Alaska, authorities could have inspected the harvest and removed the infected crab before leaving Alaska.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation.United States v. Ramiro Hernandez Tziquin, et al.No. 8:23-CR-00058 (District of Nebraska)AUSA Donald KleineAUSA Kimberly BunjerOn October 23, 2024, a court sentenced Ramiro Hernandez Tziquin, a Guatemalan citizen, to time-served for violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. § 668(a)). Tziquin has been in custody since June 6, 2024. Hernandez Tziquin is subject to removal proceedings with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Co-defendant Domingo Zetino Hernandez was sentenced in November 2023 to time served.On February 28, 2023, law enforcement received a report of a suspicious vehicle located at the Wood Duck Wildlife Management Area, located in Stanton County, Nebraska. They found the vehicle and questioned the defendants. Zetino Hernandez admitted that he shot a bird and that it was in the trunk of Hernandez Tziquin’s vehicle. Law enforcement confirmed that the carcass was indeed that of a bald eagle.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, Nebraska Games and Parks Commission, and the Stanton County Sheriff’s Office, conducted the investigation.United States v. Envigo RMS, LLC, et al.No. 6:24-CR-00016 (Western District of Virginia)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Banu RangarajanECS Trial Attorney Sarah BrownECS Paralegal Jillian GrubbAUSA Randy RamseyerAUSA Corey HallAUSA Carrie MaconSAUSA Michelle WelchOn October 24, 2024, a court sentenced Envigo RMS, LLC, and Envigo Global Services, Inc. to pay a total criminal fine of $22 million. Envigo RMS pleaded guilty to conspiring to knowingly violate the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), and Envigo Global Services pleaded guilty to conspiring to knowingly violate the Clean Water Act (CWA) (18 U.S.C. § 371; 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311, 1319(c)(2)(A), 7 U.S.C. § 2149(d)). This case is related to the breeding, export, and sale of dogs for medical and scientific research purposes from a dog breeding facility located in Cumberland County, Virginia. In May 2022, officials rescued more than 4,000 beagles from the premises.As part of the resolution, Inotiv, the parent corporation of Envigo RMS and Envigo Global Services, will guarantee more than $35 million in payments, is subject to increased animal care standards, and engage a compliance monitor. This resolution marks the largest agreed-to fine in an AWA case.Envigo RMS violated the AWA by failing to provide, among other things, adequate veterinary care, adequate staffing, and safe living conditions for dogs housed at the Cumberland County facility. In addition, Envigo Global Services violated the CWA by failing to properly operate and maintain the wastewater treatment plant, leading to massive unlawful discharges of insufficiently treated wastewater into a local waterway.

AMVAC Chemical Corporation, et al.Nos. 1:24-CR-00043, 1:22-CR-00060 (Southern District of Alabama)ECS Senior Counsel Kris DigheAUSA Michael AndersonRCEC Jennifer LewisECS Paralegal Chloe HarrisOn October 25, 2024, a court sentenced AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) to pay a $400,000 fine and to complete a three-year term of probation. The corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for transporting hazardous waste without a hazardous waste manifest (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(5)).AMVAC is a pesticide manufacturer that produced a pesticide called “Thimet” in Alabama and exported it to Canada, Australia, and other countries. Thimet is an organophosphate insecticide used to control crop pests by absorption into the crops themselves. In 2013, authorities determined that AMVAC was importing tens of thousands of used containers of Thimet through Savannah, Georgia; Port Huron, Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts; and Los Angeles, California. Some of the containers were nearly empty, while others were partially full. The containers were designed to attach directly to farming equipment and then be returned to AMVAC when emptied.The containers were not labeled as containing hazardous waste but as containing product (pesticide) for reformulation. However, the Environmental Protection Agency did not authorized AMVAC to reformulate Thimet. The active ingredient in Thimet is “phorate,” a RCRA acute hazardous waste. AMVAC is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, with specific, known responsibilities under RCRA. AMVAC subsequently told EPA that the pesticide in the containers was imported for disposal. AMVAC failed to use hazardous manifests to transport the containers of waste Thimet to its Alabama facility.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.

(Gremex) to pay a $1.75 million fine, serve a four-year term of probation, and implement an environmental compliance plan. The shipping corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) for failing to maintain an accurate oil record book (ORB) (33 U.S.C. § 1908(a)).Gremex is a Mexican corporation that managed several ships including the&nbsp;M/V Suhar. The Suhar is a 7,602 gross ton Panamanian-flagged ocean-going bulk carrier that routinely hauled cement from Tampico, Mexico, to Pensacola, Florida. Gremex was responsible for the&nbsp;Suhar’s&nbsp;day-to-day operations, including hiring all crew, and ensuring compliance with all environmental and international regulations.The Coast Guard inspected the ship when it arrived in Pensacola on August 25, 2023. Inspectors determined that the vessel’s crew regularly discharged untreated oily bilge water overboard, bypassing onboard pollution control equipment, and falsified the ship’s ORB to conceal these discharges.The U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service conducted the investigation.Related Press Release: Office of Public Affairs | Ship Management Company Fined $1.75M for Failing to Maintain an Accurate Oil Record Book that Concealed Unauthorized Discharges at Sea | United States Department of JusticeUnited States v. Travis J. Branson, et al.No. 9:23-CR-00055 (District of Montana)AUSA Randy TannerAUSA Ryan WeldonOn October 31, 2024, a court sentenced Travis J. Branson to 46 months’ incarceration, followed by 36 months of supervised release. Branson also was ordered to pay $777,250 in restitution into the Lacey Act Reward Fund. Branson pleaded guilty to conspiracy and violations of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Lacey Act. Branson and co-defendant Simon Paul (a fugitive) unlawfully killed bald and golden eagles on the Flathead Indian Reservation and elsewhere in Montana, Idaho, and Nevada, and sold them on the black market (18 U.S.C. § 371; 16 U.S.C. §§ 668(a); 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(1)(B)).Between January 2015 and March 2021, the defendants conspired to illegally kill bald and golden eagles on the Reservation and offer eagle feathers and parts for sale to domestic U.S. and international buyers. Branson traveled from Washington to the Reservation and arranged for Paul to shoot and ship the eagles for him.&nbsp;Confederated Salish &amp; Kootenai tribal authorities&nbsp;tipped off Fish and Wildlife agents to the defendants’ activity.In total, Paul and Branson killed approximately 3,600 birds, including eagles. They then sold eagle feathers and parts on the black market for significant sums of money across the United States and elsewhere. Officials estimated that between 2009 and 2021, Branson made between $180,000 and $360,000 by selling eagles feathers and parts on the black market.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes’ Fish and Game Department conducted the investigation.Related Press Release:&nbsp;District of Montana | Washington man sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison for

Usifo, et al.No. 24-CR-00040 (Eastern District of Arkansas)AUSA Edward WalkerOn October 22, 2024, Keidrick Damond Usifo and Deon Johnson pleaded guilty to violating the Big Cat Public Safety Act (BCPSA)(16 U.S.C. §§ 3372 (e)(1)(A), 3373 (d)).Lawmakers enacted the&nbsp;BCPSA in December 2022 to protect the public by prohibiting the private ownership of big cats, such as tigers and lions, as pets and by prohibiting exhibitors from allowing public contact with big cats, including tiger cubs. This law places new restrictions on the commerce, breeding, possession, and use of certain big cat species.In April 2023, a citizen tipped off local game authorities after seeing a tiger cub in a residential neighborhood in Conway, Arkansas. Further investigation confirmed that Usifo purchased a tiger in March 2023 from a broker in Dallas, Texas, and brought it back to his residence in Arkansas.After a second complaint was filed about the tiger cub, law enforcement conducted a traffic stop on April 21, 2023, arresting Usifo on a felony state warrant. The Conway Police Department then executed a search warrant at Usifo’s residence. The animal was not there, but they found evidence of its presence, including the fact that rooms in the house matched those in photos of the tiger that Usifo posted on Instagram.While in the Pulaski County Detention Facility (PCDF), Usifo made several calls to Johnson. Johnson fed the tiger for Usifo while he was held in detention.

In addition, he was ordered to pay $3,000 to the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. This sentence follows a previous conviction for his mother, Griselda Guadalupe Montoya-Gastelum, who received an 18-month prison sentence, also with three years of supervised release. Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Lacey Act for trafficking in protected wildlife (18 U.S.C. § 371; 16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(1)B)).The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began investigating the defendants in August 2022 after receiving a report from a person who purchased four exotic parrots and believed Rabago Montoya had illegally imported the birds. Further investigation determined that the defendants illegally imported exotic and protected wildlife, including tigers, panthers, monkeys, and&nbsp;parrots, from Mexico into the United States.In January 2023, agents executed a search warrant at Carlos Castro’s home, where they found a tiger cub, an alligator, 12 snapping turtles, six tortoises, and boxes of other reptiles. Snapchat messages revealed that Montoya-Gastelum and Castro discussed illegal exotic animal sales and trades. A court in Maricopa County subsequently convicted Castro of Unlawful Sale of Wildlife in the Arizona Superior Court.In April and May of 2023, federal agents received information about spider monkeys being sold on Facebook.

Tibbetts also will perform 1,000 hours of community service. Tibbets pleaded guilty to obstructing a pending proceeding related to a demolition project (18 U.S.C. § 1505). Co-defendant Brek Pilling was sentenced in August 2024 to pay a $100,000 fine, and complete a five-year term of probation, to include three months of home confinement. He also will perform 100 hours of community service. Pilling pleaded guilty to a Clean Air Act negligent endangerment count (42 U.S.C. § 7413).In late 2017, Pilling and Tibbets purchased two buildings in Burley, Idaho, planning to demolish them and build a parking lot. During a walkthrough with city officials, the building inspector pointed out likely asbestos-containing material (ACM). In further communications with the city, other city employees warned the owners about the presence of ACM requiring remediation. The owners took “samples” from the buildings that included wood, brick, and stone (but no building materials that could plausibly be composed of ACM) and submitted those to a forensic lab for analysis.In January 2018, both buildings caught fire under suspicious circumstances. After seeing the fire on the news, a local contractor contacted the defendants and offered to demolish what remained of the buildings using his own asbestos inspector and remediation company. The owners accepted the contractor’s bid but said they would hire their own remediation company. Two days later, the contractor saw the buildings under demolition. The defendants chose to hire an individual to knock them down without conducting any asbestos abatement. During the demolition, individuals hauled several truckloads of debris to a nearby landfill. The owners also lied to an inspector during a subsequent conversation about onsite testing.The National Enforcement Investigation Center analyzed samples taken from the sites and found multiple areas with ACM. Officials ultimately removed approximately 860 tons of asbestos-contaminated demolition debris from the site, at a cost of approximately $845,000.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.United States v.

Co-defendant Justin Welch was sentenced on October 1, 2024, to pay a $10,000 fine and complete a three-year term of probation. A restitution hearing is scheduled for December 10, 2024. Potter and Welch pleaded guilty to violating the Lacey Act for their roles in illegally transporting crab from Alaska (16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(2)(A), 3373(d)(1)(B)). Corey Potter is set for a status conference on December 11, 2024.Corey Potter owns two crab catching vessels; Kyle Potter and Welch worked as vessel captains. In February and March 2024, the vessels harvested more than 7,000 pounds of Tanner and Golden king crab in Southeast Alaska. Corey Potter directed Welch and Kyle Potter to take the crab to Seattle, Washington, where they intended to sell it at a higher price than they would have in Alaska. Neither captain landed the harvested crab at a port in Alaska, and they never recorded the harvest on a fish ticket, as required under state law.A large portion of the king crab that arrived in Seattle from Alaska had died and was unmarketable. Corey Potter knew that some of the crab aboard was infected with Bitter Crab Syndrome (BCS), a parasitic disease fatal to crustaceans. Officials were forced to destroy more than 4,000 additional pounds of Tanner crab due to the risk of BCS infection. If the defendants had properly landed the crab in Alaska, authorities could have inspected the harvest and removed the infected crab before leaving Alaska.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation.United States v.

This case is related to the breeding, export, and sale of dogs for medical and scientific research purposes from a dog breeding facility located in Cumberland County, Virginia. In May 2022, officials rescued more than 4,000 beagles from the premises.As part of the resolution, Inotiv, the parent corporation of Envigo RMS and Envigo Global Services, will guarantee more than $35 million in payments, is subject to increased animal care standards, and engage a compliance monitor. This resolution marks the largest agreed-to fine in an AWA case.Envigo RMS violated the AWA by failing to provide, among other things, adequate veterinary care, adequate staffing, and safe living conditions for dogs housed at the Cumberland County facility. In addition, Envigo Global Services violated the CWA by failing to properly operate and maintain the wastewater treatment plant, leading to massive unlawful discharges of insufficiently treated wastewater into a local waterway. This failure also impacted the health and well-being of the dogs at the facility.In addition to the $22 million fine, the entities will pay approximately $1.1 million to the Virginia Animal Fighting Task Force and approximately $1.9 million to the Humane Society of the United States for direct assistance provided to the investigation. The defendants also will complete five-year terms of probation.The defendants will pay an additional $3.5 million to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to benefit and restore the environment and ecosystems in Cumberland County, with approximately $500,000 dedicated to purchasing riparian wetland or riparian land located in or near Cumberland.

The corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for transporting hazardous waste without a hazardous waste manifest (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(5)).AMVAC is a pesticide manufacturer that produced a pesticide called “Thimet” in Alabama and exported it to Canada, Australia, and other countries. Thimet is an organophosphate insecticide used to control crop pests by absorption into the crops themselves. In 2013, authorities determined that AMVAC was importing tens of thousands of used containers of Thimet through Savannah, Georgia; Port Huron, Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts; and Los Angeles, California. Some of the containers were nearly empty, while others were partially full. The containers were designed to attach directly to farming equipment and then be returned to AMVAC when emptied.The containers were not labeled as containing hazardous waste but as containing product (pesticide) for reformulation. However, the Environmental Protection Agency did not authorized AMVAC to reformulate Thimet. The active ingredient in Thimet is “phorate,” a RCRA acute hazardous waste. AMVAC is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, with specific, known responsibilities under RCRA. AMVAC subsequently told EPA that the pesticide in the containers was imported for disposal. AMVAC failed to use hazardous manifests to transport the containers of waste Thimet to its Alabama facility.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.

A scam operator calling itself the “Bankruptcy Fraud Watchdog Group” has recently set its sights on consumer debtors, sending letters falsely accusing debtors of failing to disclose assets in their bankruptcy cases. These letters threaten referrals to “the United States Bankruptcy Trustee” for fraud unless the debtors promptly pay “a one-time amnesty fine” of $450 in Bitcoin via a QR code to avoid “further legal consequences.” They also falsely state that debtors who share the letters with their attorneys will face “immediate referral for criminal prosecution.”As the actual watchdog of the bankruptcy system, the U.S. Trustee Program (USTP) identifies and helps investigate allegations of fraud or abuse, including schemes exploiting vulnerable consumers in bankruptcy. Accordingly, debtors should report contacts from the so-called “Bankruptcy Fraud Watchdog Group” or other suspicious communications to the USTP’s bankruptcy fraud hotline or to their local U.S. Trustee office.Consumer debtors can help protect themselves by looking out for common signs of schemes.

Department of State’s Office of Global Criminal Justice (GCJ), met with the Bangladesh Police Reform Committee (BPRC) to discuss current challenges and future plans for police reform in Bangladesh. The BPRC, led by Chief Safar Raj Hossain, outlined several areas for improvement, including revising laws and policies, addressing the \"angry mob\" issue, eliminating arbitrary false charges, and promoting a career prosecution service. The committee emphasized the need to remove police from political influence, reduce corruption, and improve logistics, manpower, and equipment. Additionally, they outlined short- and long-term goals to foster better police-citizen relations, transition from confession-based to scientifically based investigations, enhance human rights enforcement, and improve communication and cooperation across the police, prison, and judicial sectors. The U.S. delegation highlighted its ongoing efforts to assist Bangladesh’s law enforcement reform through targeted support, focusing on strengthening police capabilities and judicial processes. The Deputy Ambassador-at-Large for GCJ briefed the committee on U.S. work related to war crimes, human rights violations, and the recent crisis facing the country. The GCJ also provided the committee with reports detailing areas where U.S. assistance could be focused. ICITAP’s Law Enforcement Assistance Attaché (LEAA) reviewed two decades of police and prison support, offering detailed insights into opportunities for future assistance. This included a draft revision of the Bangladesh Police Ordinance (BPO), developed in partnership with senior police officials. The BPRC expressed appreciation for these contributions, particularly the draft BPO, which they planned to incorporate into their final report. At the conclusion of the meeting, the BPRC Chief thanked ICITAP and GCJ for their continued support and expressed a desire to build on this partnership to strengthen Bangladesh's police, prison, and judicial systems. The committee also requested ICITAP’s expertise in developing Basic Principles of Policing and guidance on preventing lower-ranking officers from following unlawful orders. ICITAP’s LEAA subsequently forwarded the BPO draft and a copy of the internationally recognized Basic Principles of Policing to the BPRC Chief for further review and potential inclusion in the committee's final recommendations. #> 6

Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) program conducted a surveillance and counter surveillance training for 15 female officers in Jordan’s Public Security Directorate's (PSD) Special Branch (SB). The officers participating in the training are assigned to the SB’s Special Surveillance Unit and/or the newly established All-Female Counterterrorism Team. The training lasted three weeks in total and covered elements critical to physical surveillance operations, such as mission planning, foot and vehicle surveillance, threat recognition, among other topics. This training is the first of two iterations planned for SB in closing of 2024 activities.

Reading Room RequirementsOne of the recommendations contained in the May 30, 2008 Attorney General's Report to the President on agency progress under Executive Order 13,392, \"Improving Agency Disclosure of Information,\" requires agency Chief FOIA Officers to certify to the Department of Justice and OMB that their agency Reading Rooms are in compliance with the FOIA. To do so, agency Chief FOIA Officers are asked first to conduct an internal review of their agency FOIA Reading Rooms to ensure that they contain all elements required by the law. If any deficiencies are identified, they must be addressed. Finally, by October 31, 2008, all agency Chief FOIA Officers must certify that their FOIA Reading Rooms are in compliance with the law.The issuance of Executive Order 13,392 has brought increased attention to the topic of FOIA Reading Rooms in particular, and FOIA websites more generally. The FOIA imposes requirements on agencies to maintain certain categories of agency records in agency Reading Rooms where they are made available for public inspection and copying. The Department of Justice, over the years, has issued extensive guidance to agencies on the requirements of agency FOIA Reading Rooms. That guidance is summarized and referenced in the Department of Justice's Freedom of Information Act Guide (Mar. 2007 ed.), which is available on the Department's website.As the Attorney General's Report to the President notes, \"while the Executive Order has prompted improvements to agency FOIA Reading Rooms, some agencies still need to devote more attention to ensuring that, at a minimum, their Reading Rooms contain all the material that is required by the FOIA to be included there.\"The guidance dated June 25, 2008, set out below, was sent to Chief FOIA Officers by the Office of Information and Privacy (OIP), and addresses the Attorney General's recommendation for submission of a certification of compliance with the FOIA for each agency's FOIA Reading Room. The certification is required to be submitted first in draft form to OIP by October 17, 2008. Each agency Chief FOIA Officer must then submit the final certification to OMB and the Department of Justice by October 31, 2008.MEMORANDUM FOR AGENCY CHIEF FOIA OFFICERSFROM: Director, Office of Information and Privacy; U.S. Department of JusticeSUBJECT: Guidance on Submitting Certification of Agency Compliance with FOIA's Reading Room RequirementsThis memorandum provides guidance for providing certification to the Department of Justice and OMB by October 31, 2008 that your agency's FOIA Reading Room is in compliance with the FOIA. All agency Chief FOIA Officers must provide this certification.BACKGROUNDOn May 30, 2008, the Attorney General issued his third Report to the President pursuant to Executive Order 13,392. This Attorney General Report is based on the Fiscal Year 2007 Annual FOIA Reports that agencies submitted earlier this year and provides an update on the agencies implementation of the FOIA and of their FOIA Improvement Plans. In accordance with Section 4(a) of the Executive Order, the Attorney General's Report includes recommendations for improving agency FOIA administration. The third recommendation requires each agency Chief FOIA Officer to conduct a review of their agency's FOIA Reading Room(s); to address any deficiencies in its content; and then to certify to the Department of Justice and OMB that its Reading Room is in compliance with the requirements of the FOIA.As described in the Attorney General's Report, the Department of Justice has been actively engaged in a series of steps focused on the issue of FOIA Reading Rooms. In particular, the Department has added the topic of FOIA Reading Rooms to many of its training programs so that agency personnel are fully apprised of the requirements imposed by the FOIA for posting documents. In addition, as the Report points out, the Department of Justice has launched an initiative to reach out to those agencies that it has identified as having Reading Rooms in need of improvement. These outreach efforts will be an on-going process as agencies work to improve both their Reading Rooms and their websites overall.READING ROOM REQUIREMENTSUnder subsection (a)(2) of the FOIA, federal agencies must make four distinct categories of records affirmatively available for \"public inspection and copying.\" Agencies must satisfy this \"Reading Room\" provision of the FOIA by providing the designated documents either solely in electronic Reading Rooms on agency websites, or in a combination of electronic and conventional \"paper\" Reading Rooms. Agencies should be mindful that the Reading Room provision of the FOIA imposes an affirmative disclosure requirement and, as such, agencies are obligated to not only maintain, but also to continuously update, each of the four categories of Reading Room records.A. Description of Reading Room RecordsAs noted above, agency Reading Rooms must contain four distinct categories of records. Agencies should organize the records in a way that allows for efficient and easy location of specific documents. This may be accomplished by physically separating the records, in the case of conventional reading rooms, or by listing the records under separate links or headings, in the case of electronic Reading Rooms. One approach is to separate the records by the four categories listed in the statute. Agencies are free to separate and organize the records in any other manner that the agency determines, from a citizen-centered perspective, will best serve the needs of the community of individuals and entities that visit and use the agency's website.The four categories of Reading Room records are:\\t\"final opinions [and] . . . orders\" made in the adjudication of cases;\\tspecific agency policy statements;\\t\"administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public\"; and\\trecords disclosed in response to a FOIA request that \"the agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records.\"Additionally, agencies should note that records which are published and offered for sale by an agency are excluded from the definition of Reading Room records. Thus, even if a particular record would otherwise be designated a Reading Room record, if it is published and offered for sale it need not be included in the agency's Reading Room. Similarly, records published under the provisions of (a)(1) - the Federal Register requirement for publishing basic information about the organization of the agency - are to be excluded from the definition of Reading Room records.B. Reading Room IndicesAgencies should index or otherwise organize the records to facilitate their location in the Reading Room. The index requirement is met by any organizational system which substantially enables a member of the public to locate desired materials in the Reading Room. The FOIA specifically requires that agencies provide a \"general index\" of those records falling into the fourth Reading Room category (also known as the \"frequently requested records\" category). Because, as noted below, all \"frequently requested\" records must be posted in electronic, rather than conventional, Reading Rooms, this indexing requirement may be satisfied by simply providing a distinct \"link\" to each document in this category.C. Electronic Reading RoomsAgencies must make the records created by them on or after November 1, 1996 in all four Reading Room categories available to the public by \"electronic means.\" Agencies accomplish this electronic availability through the use of electronic Reading Rooms on their FOIA websites. Because the \"frequently requested records\" category of Reading Room records was not effective until March 31, 1997, this category of records is, as a practical matter, always included in electronic Reading Rooms.For records created by an agency before November 1, 1996, agencies may continue to maintain conventional Reading Rooms, where paper copies of all subsection (a)(2) documents are available for inspection and copying. The location of each agency's conventional Reading Room should be indicated on its FOIA Web page. For those agencies which no longer maintain conventional Reading Rooms, a computer terminal through which a member of the public may, upon request, access the agency's electronic Reading Room must be provided. In such instances, instructions for using this arrangement should be provided on the agency's FOIA website.For additional information see Office of Management and Budget Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies Concerning Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites (Dec. 17, 2004); Office of Management and Budget Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies Concerning Improving Public Access to and Dissemination of Government Information and Using the Federal Enterprise Architecture Data Reference Model (Dec. 16, 2005).REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION OF AGENCY READING ROOMSA. Timing of the FOIA Reading Room CertificationIn order to appropriately ensure that agency certifications incorporate the components detailed below, each agency must submit a draft of their FOIA Reading Room Certification to the Department of Justice for review by October 17, 2008.Each agency Chief FOIA Officer must then submit a finalized FOIA Reading Room Certification by October 31, 2008, to both the Department of Justice and OMB. Each agency must also post their FOIA Reading Room Certification on its FOIA website.B. Preparing the FOIA Reading Room CertificationAs noted above, each agency Chief FOIA Officer must conduct an internal review of its agency's FOIA Reading Room(s), address any deficiencies identified, and certify that those Reading Rooms are in compliance with the FOIA. In order to comply with this requirement all agencies should follow the procedure set out below.\\tGeneral Issues\\tFOIA Reading Rooms are a required element for all agency FOIA websites. For any agency that fulfills its Reading Room requirement by maintaining multiple Reading Rooms, all such Reading Rooms should be reviewed, any deficiencies addressed, and the certification should identify each Reading Room that was reviewed.\\t\\tA \"deficiency\" in the content of a Reading Room means any failure to comply with the statutory requirements for the establishment and maintenance of a FOIA Reading Room.\\t&nbsp;\\tTemplate for Certification of FOIA Reading Rooms\\t\\tEach agency Chief FOIA Officer must complete the following template for providing certification for his/her agency.\\tInternal Review of Agency FOIA Reading Room\\tProvide a statement that your agency FOIA Reading Room was reviewed for purposes of determining whether it was in compliance with the legal requirements for FOIA Reading Rooms. If your agency has more than one Reading Room, identify each Reading Room that was reviewed.\\t&nbsp;\\tAny Reading Room Deficiencies Addressed\\t\\tProvide, if applicable, a general description of the nature of any deficiencies located during the review of the Reading Room and the corrective steps taken to address them.\\t&nbsp;\\tCertification\\t\\tProvide a certification that after review and the remedying of any deficiencies, the agency's Reading Room is in compliance with the requirements of the FOIA.C. Submitting the Reading Room CertificationEach agency's Reading Room Certification must be made by the agency's Chief FOIA Officer.\\tGuidelines for Submitting\\tBy October 17, 2008, submit the draft Reading Room Certification for review by e-mail to DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov.\\t\\tBy October 31, 2008, submit the final, cleared Reading Room Certification to OMB at FOIAreporting@omb.eop.gov and to the Department of Justice at the e-mail noted above.\\t&nbsp;\\tContacts\\t\\tAgencies with questions regarding this matter should contact Vanessa Brinkmann at the Department of Justice's Office of

                                      Presidential Statement and White House Memorandum on the FOIA Issued During Sunshine WeekOn March 16, 2010, during Sunshine Week, the White House issued both a Presidential Statement and a Memorandum on the FOIA.&nbsp; First, President Obama issued a statement on the FOIA.&nbsp; In his Statement, the President applauded the work that has been done so far to increase transparency.&nbsp; He also recommitted his administration “to be the most open and transparent ever.”&nbsp; After highlighting some of the transparency initiatives the White House has undertaken, the President concluded by stating that “our work is not done” and that “[w]e will continue to work toward an unmatched level of transparency, participation, and accountability across the entire Administration.”On that same day, Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff, and Bob Bauer, Counsel to the President, issued a Memorandum to the Heads of Departments and Agencies on the Freedom of Information Act.&nbsp; The Memorandum highlights the successful work that has been done by agencies “to make the government more open and accountable to the American people.”&nbsp; The White House also expressed appreciation to agencies for their efforts in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and confidence that agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports will demonstrate the progress achieved thus far.At the same time, the White House points out that “more work remains to be done, and such work requires persistent effort.”&nbsp; The White House requests department and agency heads to take action in two specific areas “to ensure full implementation of the President's Memorandum on FOIA.”&nbsp;First, agencies are instructed to update all their FOIA guidance and training materials “to include the principles articulated in the President's Memorandum.”&nbsp; Second, the White House directs agencies to “assess whether [they] are devoting adequate resources to responding to FOIA requests promptly and cooperatively, consistent with the requirements for addressing this Presidential priority.”The Memorandum closes by noting that agencies may already be taking these and other steps as part of their drafting of their Open Government Plans, which are being developed as a result of the Open Government Directive.As these White House transmissions convey, agencies should be very proud of the work they have accomplished thus far in improving transparency.&nbsp; Although there is more work to be done in the year ahead, a preliminary review of&nbsp;agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports reveals that the key agencies across the government, which handle the bulk of the FOIA requests, have made real progress in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; Complete details about agency activities and progress will be forthcoming in OIP's report on its review and analysis of the Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&nbsp; A summary containing highlights from those reports is available on our website. #> 3

                                                                       Guidance for Further Improvement Based on 2013 Chief FOIA OfficerReport Review and Assessment As illustrated by OIP's 2013 Assessment of Agency Progress in Implementing the President's and Attorney General's FOIA Memoranda, agencies have accomplished a great deal over the past year to apply the presumption of openness, make more proactive disclosures, utilize technology for the benefit of FOIA administration, improve timeliness, and reduce backlogs. While the government overall has made significant improvements, the results achieved by individual agencies vary. OIP's Assessment serves as a visual snapshot of where each agency should focus its efforts in the upcoming year to achieve even greater success in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines. To assist agencies, OIP offers the following guidance based on our 2013 Assessment.Focus on Quality TrainingA proper understanding of the FOIA, including the correct application of the statute's provisions and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines, is the first step towards any successful FOIA operation. OIP's Assessment shows that the vast majority of agencies are either holding training conferences or sending their FOIA professionals to training hosted by other agencies. These efforts vary by agency, though, with some agencies citing one or two training sessions attended by staff and others hosting multiple FOIA conferences and having all of their FOIA professionals attend regular training.OIP advises every agency to make FOIA training available to all their FOIA professionals at least once each year. Moreover, it is essential that FOIA training programs cover core, substantive aspects of FOIA administration. Agencies that have been engaged in robust training initiatives should continue these efforts. Agencies that are in need of training are encouraged to take advantage of the many FOIA training opportunities available around the government or to plan a comprehensive FOIA conference tailored to the needs of their own agency. OIP regularly conducts a number of government-wide training sessions that cover all aspects of the FOIA. OIP's subject matter experts are also available to provide specialized training for agencies on any FOIA topic. For more information about OIP's upcoming training events and how to attend please visit the \"Training\" page of our website. In addition, agencies can contact OIP’s Training Officer to arrange for assistance in holding an in-house training program.Focus on Processing “Simple” Track Requests Within Twenty Working DaysThe Attorney General has emphasized that \"[t]imely disclosure of information is an essential component of transparency.\" The government overall showed improvement on this front with sixty-three agencies processing their \"simple track\" requests within an average of twenty days or less and several more being very close to meeting this goal. However, there are still a number of agencies with longer processing times. Agencies that are taking longer than an average of twenty days to process their simple requests should reexamine their FOIA process and strive to meet this milestone. Furthermore, OIP advises those agencies with high processing times that have not established multi-track processing to consider doing so. As explained in last year's guidance, multi-track systems provide a mechanism for agencies to process their simple requests in a different queue from their complex requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the simple requests. Differentiating the processing queues also allows agencies to provide requesters with meaningful choices regarding processing times, based on the complexity of the request.Focus on Closing the “Ten Oldest”Finally, all agencies should continue to make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each fiscal year. Our sustained efforts to close these requests and appeals every year is essential to reducing the age of the government's backlogs and resolving those cases that have been lingering for years.In addition to closing their oldest requests and appeals, for those agencies that receive consultations from other agencies it is equally important to close their ten oldest pending consultations. This ensures that the agencies that sent the consultations can have the responses they need in order to close out the requests. #> 4

continue to make concrete progress in implementing the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; The 2012 assessment shows that agencies are applying the presumption of openness, are taking steps to ensure that they have effective systems in place for responding to requests, are increasing both the content on their websites and its usability, and are offering requesters the opportunity to submit requests electronically.While more than half the agencies are utilizing advanced technology to help with core processing tasks like improved document searches, streamlined consultation processes, and more efficient document review, there are many that have not yet explored those options.&nbsp; In this era of lean resources, as agencies face competing priorities, they understandably may also face challenges in acquiring new technology.&nbsp; At the same time, agencies are encouraged to assess the cost effectiveness as well as the benefits of more advanced technological tools that could be used to achieve greater efficiency in the core elements of FOIA processing, particularly improved document searches and review.As to improving timeliness, agencies that do not currently offer multi-track processing, and which take longer than twenty working days on average to respond to requests, should consider establishing a multi-track system.&nbsp; A multi-track system will provide a mechanism for the agency to process \"simple\" requests in a different queue from \"complex\" requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the \"simple\" track requests.&nbsp; Additionally, by establishing multiple processing tracks, agencies can more readily offer requesters the option of tailoring their request so that it fits within the \"simple\" track and can be processed more quickly.Lastly, all agencies should make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each year.&nbsp; By doing so systematically, year after year, the government overall will be able to reduce the age of its backlog and eliminate those lingering requests that have remained pending for many years.&nbsp; #> 6

A search of her purse revealed approximately 444.4 grams of methamphetamine, a scale, and paraphernalia. Her vehicle contained $7,911 in United States currency, 46.3 grams of methamphetamine, and drug paraphernalia.

LaFournaise was aware of this prohibition. On May 11, 2024, a relative of LaFournaise reported to the Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office that he was threatening family members at their home. LaFournaise was ultimately arrested for partner or family member assault, and his relative then revealed the cause of his agitation: he had returned from work to discover that his bag—which contained a handgun and drug paraphernalia—was missing. A family member had found the bag earlier that day and had hidden it from LaFournaise upon discovering the gun inside of it. The gun was identified as a Kel-Tec 9 mm pistol.When LaFournaise was interviewed by law enforcement, he admitted he received the gun from a friend and was holding on to it. The friend was interviewed and confirmed giving the gun to LaFournaise because LaFournaise needed it “for protection” when getting drugs.The U.S. Attorney’s Office prosecuted the case and the investigation was conducted by the ATF, Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office and Montana Probation and Parole Office.This case is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and gun violence, and to make our neighborhoods safer for everyone. On May 26, 2021, the Department launched a violent crime reduction strategy strengthening PSN based on these core principles: fostering trust and legitimacy in our communities, supporting community-based organizations that help prevent violence from occurring in the first place, setting focused and strategic enforcement priorities, and measuring the results.

Co. Ltd. and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. have agreed to plead guilty and serve jail time in the United States for participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) panels, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today.      According to a one-count felony charge filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chang Suk \"C.S.\" Chung, a Korean LG executive, conspired with unnamed employees from other panel makers to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels from on or about Sept. 21, 2001, to on or about June 1, 2006. According to a separate one-count felony charge, also filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chieng-Hon \"Frank\" Lin, a Taiwanese former executive from Chunghwa, and Chih-Chun \"C.C.\" Liu and Hsueh-Lung \"Brian\" Lee, Taiwanese current employees of Chungwha, are charged with participating in the same conspiracy at various times during the period from Sept. 14, 2001, to on or about Dec. 1, 2006.      Under the plea agreements, which must be approved by the court, all four executives have agreed to serve a term of imprisonment, pay a criminal fine and assist the government in its ongoing TFT-LCD investigation.      TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. In 2006, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was approximately $70 billion.      \"These cases involve the first Taiwanese nationals to face imprisonment in the United States for an antitrust offense,\" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department of Justice is committed to holding accountable all conspirators who harm American consumers, no matter where they live or where they commit the crime.\"      During the conspiracy, Chang Suk Chung, a Korean citizen, worked as LG’s Vice President of Monitor Sales. Under the plea agreement, Chung has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $25,000 criminal fine.      During the charged conspiracy period, Chieng-Hon Lin, a Taiwanese and U.S. citizen, was Chunghwa’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Under the plea agreement, Lin has agreed to serve a nine-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $50,000 criminal fine.      Chih-Chun Liu, a Taiwanese citizen, was Chunghwa’s Vice President of LCD Sales during the charged conspiracy period. Under the plea agreement, Liu has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $30,000 criminal fine.      Hsueh-Lung Lee, a Taiwanese citizen, held various sales positions at Chunghwa during the charged conspiracy period, including Vice President of LCD Sales. Under the plea agreement, Lee has agreed to serve a six-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $20,000 criminal fine.      These four foreign-based executives were charged with participating with co-conspirators in a conspiracy that was accomplished by:    Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT-LCD panels;  Agreeing during these meetings, conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT-LCD panels at certain predetermined levels;  Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached;  Exchanging information on sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices; and  Authorizing, ordering and consenting to the participation of subordinate employees in the conspiracy.        \"These are the first individuals to plead guilty to a charge of fixing prices in this active investigation into antitrust violations in the TFT-LCD industry,\" said Scott D. Hammond, the Antitrust Division’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement. \"We will continue in our efforts to bring to justice other domestic and foreign-based executives who were involved with fixing TFT-LCD prices.\"      On Dec. 15, 2008, LG pleaded guilty to participating in this conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $400 million criminal fine – the second largest fine in Antitrust Division history. On Jan. 14, 2009, Chunghwa pleaded guilty to participating in the same conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $65 million criminal fine.      On Dec. 16, 2008, Sharp Corp. pleaded guilty to three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels sold to Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc., and was sentenced to pay a $120 million criminal fine.      The four executives are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of $1 million and up to 10 years in prison for an individual. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.      These pleas are the result of a joint investigation by the Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Field Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Francisco.      Anyone with information concerning illegal conduct in the TFT-LCD industry is urged to call the San Francisco Field Office of the Antitrust Division at 415-436-6660. #> 2 American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company today agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.415 billion for promoting its drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice announced today. This resolution includes a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a United States criminal prosecution of any kind. Eli Lilly will also pay up to $800 million in a civil settlement with the federal government and the states.Eli Lilly agreed to enter a global resolution with the United States to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it promoted its antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA, the Department said. Such unapproved uses are also known as \"off-label\" uses because they are not included in the drug’s FDA approved product label.Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Gregory G. Katsas and acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Laurie Magid today announced the filing of a criminal information against Eli Lilly for promoting Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA. Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, is charged in the information with promoting Zyprexa for such off-label or unapproved uses as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, in elderly people.The company has signed a plea agreement admitting its guilt to a misdemeanor criminal charge. Eli Lilly also signed a civil settlement to resolve civil claims that by marketing Zyprexa for unapproved uses, it caused false claims for payment to be submitted to federal insurance programs such as Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, none of which provided coverage for such off-label uses.The plea agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay a criminal fine of $515 million and forfeit assets of $100 million. The civil settlement agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay up to an additional $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve civil allegations originally brought in four separate lawsuits under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act. The federal share of the civil settlement amount is $438 million. Under the terms of the civil settlement, Eli Lilly will pay up to $361 million to those states that opt to participate in the agreement.Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a company must specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to the FDA. Before approving a drug, the FDA must determine that the drug is safe and effective for the use proposed by the company. Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for off-label uses.The FDA originally approved Zyprexa, also known by the chemical name olanzapine, in Sept. 1996 for the treatment of manifestations of psychotic disorders. In March 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. In Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short term treatment of schizophrenia in place of the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders. Also in Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable for approximately eight weeks and were then followed for a period of up to eight months. Zyprexa has never been approved for the treatment of dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia.The criminal information, filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that from Sept. 1999 through at least Nov. 2003, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for the treatment of agitation, aggression, hostility, dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression and generalized sleep disorder. The information alleges that Eli Lilly’s management created marketing materials promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, trained its sales force to disregard the law and directed its sales personnel to promote Zyprexa for off-label uses.The information alleges that beginning in 1999, Eli Lilly expended significant resources to promote Zyprexa in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, primarily through its long-term care sales force. Eli Lilly sought to convince doctors to prescribe Zyprexa to treat patients with disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and behavioral symptoms such as agitation, aggression, and hostility.The information further alleges that the FDA never approved Zyprexa for the treatment of dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, or the cognitive deficits associated with dementia.The information also alleges that building on its unlawful promotion and success in the long-term care market, Eli Lilly executives decided to market Zyprexa to primary-care physicians. In Oct. 2000, Eli Lilly began this off-label marketing campaign targeting primary care physicians, even though the company knew that there was virtually no approved use for Zyprexa in the primary-care market. Eli Lilly trained its primary-care physician sales representatives to promote Zyprexa by focusing on symptoms, rather than Zyprexa’s FDA approved indications.The qui tam lawsuits alleged that between Sept. 1999 and the end of 2005, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for use in patients of all ages and for the treatment of anxiety, irritability, depression, nausea, Alzheimer’s and other mood disorders. The qui tam lawsuits also alleged that the company funded continuing medical education programs, through millions of dollars in grants, to promote off-label uses of its drugs, in violation of the FDA’s requirements.\"Off-label promotion of pharmaceutical drugs is a serious crime because it undermines the FDA’s role in protecting the American public by determining that a drug is safe and effective for a particular use before it is marketed,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. \"This settlement demonstrates the Department’s ongoing diligence in prosecuting cases involving violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and recovering taxpayer dollars used to pay for drugs sold as a result of off-label marketing campaigns.\"\"When pharmaceutical companies ignore the government’s process for protecting the public, they undermine the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship and place innocent people in harm’s way,\" said acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Laurie Magid. \"Off-label marketing created unnecessary risks for patients. People have an absolute right to their doctor’s medical expertise, and to know that their health care provider’s judgment has not be clouded by misinformation from a company trying to build its bottom line.\"The global resolution includes the following agreements:\\tA plea agreement signed by Eli Lilly admitting guilt to the criminal charge of misbranding. Specifically, Eli Lilly admits that between Sept. 1999 and March 31, 2001, the company promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. Eli Lilly has agreed to pay a $515 million criminal fine and to forfeit an additional $100 million in assets.\\tA civil settlement between Eli Lilly, the United States and various States, in which Eli Lilly will pay up to $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve False Claims Act claims and related state claims by Medicaid and other federal programs and agencies including TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Department of Veterans Affairs, Bureau of Prisons and the Public Health Service Entities. The federal government will receive $438,171,544 from the civil settlement. The state Medicaid programs and the District of Columbia will share up to $361,828,456 of the civil settlement, depending on the number of states that participate in the settlement.\\tThe qui tam relators will receive $78,870,877 from the federal share of the settlement amount.\\tA Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) between Eli Lilly and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that a Board of Directors committee annually review the company’s compliance program and certify its effectiveness; that certain managers annually certify that their departments or functional areas are compliant; that Eli Lilly send doctors a letter notifying them about the global settlement; and that the company post on its website information about payments to doctors, such as honoraria, travel or lodging. Eli Lilly is subject to exclusion from Federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches.\"OIG’s Corporate Integrity Agreement will increase the transparency of Eli Lilly’s interactions with physicians and strengthen Eli Lilly’s accountability for its compliance with the law,\" said Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson. \"This historic resolution demonstrates the Government’s commitment to improvethe integrity of drug promotion activities.\"In addition to the $1.415 billion criminal and civil settlement announced today, Eli Lilly previously agreed to pay $62 million to settle consumer protection lawsuits brought by 33 states. The state consumer protection settlements were announced on Oct. 7, 2008.\"Today's announcement of the filing of a criminal charge and the unprecedented terms of this settlement demonstrates the government's increasing efforts aimed at pharmaceutical companies that choose to put profits ahead of the public's health,\" said Special Agent-in-Charge Kim Rice of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations. \"The FDA will continue to devote resources to criminal investigations targeting pharmaceutical companies that disregard the safeguards of the drug approval process and recklessly promote drugs for uses for which they have not been proven to be safe and effective.\"\"The illegal scheme used by Eli Lilly significantly impacted the integrity of TRICARE, the Department of Defense's healthcare system,\" said Ed Bradley, Special Agent-in-Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service. \"This illegal activity increases patients’ costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the over nine million military members, retirees and their families who rely on this system. Today’s charges and settlement demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its partners in law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those that abuse the government's healthcare programs at the expense of the taxpayers and patients.\"\"This case should serve as still another warning to all those who break the law in order to improve their profits,\" said Patrick Doyle, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services in Philadelphia. &nbsp;\"OIG, working with our law enforcement partners, will pursue and bring to justice those who would steal from vulnerable beneficiaries and the taxpayers.\"The civil settlement resolves four qui tam actions filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania: United States ex rel.

                                                                                                              WASHINGTON—In the largest settlement yet in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ongoing cement kiln enforcement initiative, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, today lodged a consent decree with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California resolving Clean Air Act claims against CEMEX California Cement LLC with respect to the company’s Victorville, Calif., Portland cement plant.The settlement will resolve claims asserted in a 2007 complaint that CEMEX is releasing pollutants to the air, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, without required permits setting emission limits under the Clean Air Act.&nbsp; Under the terms of the settlement, CEMEX must meet new limits for these pollutants at the Victorville plant, one of the largest cement plants in the United States, including stringent new limits for nitrogen oxide that will reduce emissions by 1,890 tons per year, a nearly 40 percent reduction.&nbsp; The cement manufacturer must also pay a $2 million civil penalty.&nbsp; EPA estimates that achieving and maintaining compliance with the new emission limits, depending on the control technology used, could cost CEMEX millions of dollars.“Today’s settlement shows the federal government’s continued commitment to enforcing the federal environmental laws and protecting the nation’s air quality,” said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.“This settlement will result in cleaner air for California,” said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA’s Air Division in the Pacific Southwest region.&nbsp; “This facility is the largest source of nitrogen oxide—an air pollutant that causes smog—in California, so the state-of-the-art air pollution controls that CEMEX is installing will have a significant impact on air quality.”The settlement resolves the EPA’s claims that on two separate occasions, in 1997 and 2000, CEMEX violated the Clean Air Act by undertaking major plant modifications resulting in significant increases in the Victorville plant’s capacity to pollute without first undergoing required regulatory review or obtaining required permits under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, program and without installing state-of-the-art emission controls that would reduce contaminants such as nitrogen oxide.&nbsp;Nitrogen oxide is a harmful air pollutant that causes smog and leads to respiratory problems in children and the elderly.&nbsp; The Victorville area fails to meet federal air quality standards for both ozone and particulate matter.The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.&nbsp; A copy of the consent decree is available on the Department of Justice Web site at http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html.&nbsp; For more information on the settlement and the Clean Air Act, please visit:

of Review, which upholds the constitutionality of foreign intelligence surveillance conducted under the Protect America Act of 2007.      \"The case involved a challenge by a private party to directives that were issued under the Protect America Act and that required the party to assist the Government in conducting foreign intelligence surveillance against targets reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. The Court of Review upheld the lawfulness of the directives, concluding that the surveillance at issue fell within the foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement and was otherwise reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.      \"The Court issued a classified version of its opinion in August 2008 and subsequently requested publication of an unclassified version. Today, after a careful classification review process, the Court published the unclassified version of its opinion. The Court of Review's decision marks the second ruling published by the Court since it was established more than 30 years ago.\" #> 5

the conditions of confinement at the King County Correctional Facility in Seattle. The agreement follows the Department’s investigation of the facility, which found substantial civil rights violations.      \"I appreciate King County’s cooperation during our investigation and commend the leadership of the King County Executive and the County Council for their commitment to improve conditions at the jail,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"Today’s agreement will ensure that necessary measures are taken so that the County will meet its obligations under the law.\"      The Department’s investigation identified inadequate medical care and contagious disease prevention and treatment services, inadequate security and detention practices, and inadequate suicide prevention procedures. The agreement requires the implementation of measures to ensure that the identified deficiencies are remedied and that the services and systems to address the inadequate conditions are consistent with constitutional standards.      The Civil Rights Division conducted its investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which authorizes the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations of other adult correctional facilities in numerous other jurisdictions, including Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.      The Department of Justice’s enforcement effort reaches beyond adult correctional facilities. Since 2001, the Department of Justice has opened 97 similar investigations into conditions of confinement at correctional facilities, juvenile detention centers, nursing homes, mental health facilities and residences for persons with developmental disabilities throughout the United States.

                                 WASHINGTON – The owners and operators of two Miami medical clinics, along with a phlebotomist at one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced today.            Juan A. \"Tony\" Marrero, 41, Belkis Marrero, 41, and Luz Borrego, 43, each pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2009, to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in the Southern District of Florida. In their pleas, Tony and Belkis Marrero admitted that they co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;P).      Medcore and M&amp;P purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. The Marreros admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 they conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Borrego acknowledged her role in the fraud at Medcore where she was a phlebotomist who administered unnecessary drugs intravenously to HIV patients. Tony Marrero also pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracies to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud. Sentencing for all three defendants is scheduled for April 3, 2009.      During their pleas, the defendants admitted that Medcore and M&amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare and that the treatments for infused or injected drugs billed to Medicare were not medically necessary. Each of the defendants also admitted that all of the patients at the clinics were participants in the fraud. The defendants admitted that they, or their co-conspirators, entered into kickback arrangements with these Medicare beneficiaries whereby the beneficiaries were paid every week in exchange for their Medicare billing information, which allowed the clinics to submit the fraudulent bills.      To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Tony Marrero admitted that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.      The defendants admitted that none of the Medicare beneficiaries needed the injection and infusion treatments billed to Medicare by the clinics. Tony and Belkis Marrero acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Belkis Marrero and Borrego also admitted that they put together medical files to make them appear legitimate and that they supported the treatments being billed to Medicare.      On Jan. 7, 2009, Orlando Pascual Jr., a co-owner of Medcore and M&amp;P, pleaded guilty to his role in the Medicare fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a separate durable medical equipment company that he operated from 2001 to 2003.      On Jan. 14, 2009, Harold Sio, the owner of pharmaceutical wholesale company named Lifecare Medical, was charged by criminal information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sio, whose company supplied Medcore and M&amp;P with infusible drugs, allegedly conspired with Pascual and Tony Marrero to accomplish the health care fraud scheme by providing false invoices for the drugs allegedly used in the scheme.      Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 9, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment and an information are merely charges, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.      The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S. (Jay) Darden, and Trial Attorney Charles Reed of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General and the FBI. The case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (MFSF), supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and U.S. Attorney Acosta of the Southern District of Florida. Since the inception of MFSF operations, federal prosecutors have indicted 106 cases with 190 defendants in both Los Angeles and Miami. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for more than half a billion dollars. #>   changed created       date number #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-046 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-038 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-044 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-040 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-047 #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-042 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      teaser #> 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Executives from LG Display Co.
