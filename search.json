Durham) 和聯邦調查局紐約地區辦事處（FBI）代理助理主任萊斯利·巴克希斯 (Leslie Backschies) 宣布了逮捕和指控。美國檢察官達勒姆表示： “據稱，翁某謊稱自己是聯邦執法人員，以獲取毫無戒心的受害者的信任。” 「被告利用受害者想要成為美國公民並追求美國夢的願望，不僅竊取了這一夢想，還竊取了數十萬美元。今天，真正的執法人員給這名詐騙犯戴上了手銬，他將為自己的罪行付出代價。” 美國聯邦調查局代理助理局長巴克斯奇斯稱： “據稱，八年多來，湯米·翁偽造了一名聯邦執法人員的身份，用華麗的道具和保證合法身份的空洞保證，從弱勢受害者手中騙取了數十萬美元。” 「這名涉嫌冒名頂替者將一個受人尊敬的職業變成了一場精心策劃的陰謀，同時違背了公眾對執法部門的信任。聯邦調查局將繼續逮捕任何利用權力牟取不法利益的個人。根據法庭文件，該詐騙案始於 2016 年 4 月，當時翁某向受害者 (Jane Doe) 謊稱自己是聯邦執法人員，並解釋說，如果受害者向他投資 50 萬美元，他就可以動用其執法關係，幫助她透過 EB-5 移民投資者計劃快速獲得綠卡。 翁先生向 Jane Doe 展示了一枚執法徽章，並給了她一張印有他名字的「聯邦警官協會」名片。 還有一次，翁先生告訴 Jane Doe，他曾在美國國土安全部工作，現在將調往義大利國際刑警組織擔任新的執法職務。 翁先生駕駛著一輛紅色悍馬車，車牌上印有「ICE」的縮寫，這顯然是指聯邦執法機構移民和海關執法局。根據翁的陳述，Jane Doe 向翁提供了 50 萬美元作為簽證費用。 翁先生沒有將 Jane Doe 提供的錢用於投資，也沒有代表她提交簽證申請，而是將錢據為己有，並用一系列謊言欺騙受害者，解釋為何簽證申請過程被拖延了大約八年。起訴書中的控告均為指控，除非被證明有罪，否則被告將先被假定無罪。 一旦罪名成立，被告將面臨最高23年監禁。任何知曉翁某犯罪行為的人，請聯絡聯邦調查局，信箱為：NY_WengTips@fbi.gov該政府案件由該辦公室的普通犯罪科處理。該政府案件由美國助理檢察官納迪亞·E·摩爾 (Nadia E.

Kirkpatrick.&nbsp;As alleged in the indictment, beginning in July 2023 through January 2025, 11 defendants conspired to possess methamphetamine with the intent to distribute it. The DTO leaders arranged for large quantities of methamphetamine to be delivered from Mexico to the Twin Cities area, via the mail and driven by cars and trucks. Once delivered, the Minnesota-based defendants broke large quantities of methamphetamine down into smaller, distributable quantities and sold it to customers throughout the Twin Cities region. &nbsp;In January 2025, an individual owed a DTO leader in Mexico a substantial amount of money, which they could not pay. Four of the co-defendants lured this individual to a location in St. Paul, Minnesota. They kidnaped the victim, beat the victim, chained the victim to a pole, and the held the victim against their will. &nbsp;During the kidnaping and beating, a DTO leader instructed one of the defendants over a messaging application, “you are breaking his hands. Break them good.”&nbsp;“This case highlights the inherent danger that transnational drug cartels bring to our country,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Lisa D. Kirkpatrick. “This mob-style violence has no place in America, it has no place in Minnesota, and those who engage in it will be charged federally.” &nbsp;The following individuals have been indicted for the following crimes and have made their initial appearance in federal court:•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richar Sanchez Mujica, 30, is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, conspiracy to kidnap, and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Donovan Rey Lopez, 21, of Minneapolis is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Erling Soren Holdahl, 48, is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and conspiracy to kidnap.&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dostin Elizander Ortiz-Garcia, 29, of Burnsville, Minnesota, is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jonathan Salvador Juarez-Ferrer, 25, of Minneapolis, is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timothy Duane Ripley, 45, is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and conspiracy to kidnap.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kendra Sue Johnson, 39, is charged with conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and conspiracy to kidnap.Four other members of the conspiracy have not yet made their initial appearances.This case is the result of cooperation between Homeland Security Investigations, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, the St. Paul Police Department’s Violent Crime Enforcement Team, The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, Minneapolis Police Department, Ramsey County, and the Central Minnesota Violent Offender Task Force. &nbsp;It is part of Operation Take Back America, a nationwide initiative that marshals the full resources of the Department of Justice to eliminate cartels and transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), and to protect our communities from the perpetrators of violent crime. Operation Take Back America streamlines efforts and resources from the Department’s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETFs) and Project Safe Neighborhood (PSN).&nbsp;Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael P. McBride is prosecuting the case.&nbsp;An indictment is merely an allegation, and the defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law. #> 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WASHINGTON – Jose Anthony Contreras, 31, of Fullerton, California, was sentenced today in U.S. District Court to 120 months in prison for his role in a nationwide narcotics distribution conspiracy that brought tens of thousands of doses of illegal fentanyl from California into the Washington, D.C. area.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sentence was announced by U.S. Attorney Edward R.

                                                                                            <p>WASHINGTON—In the largest settlement yet in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ongoing cement kiln enforcement initiative, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, today lodged a consent decree with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California resolving Clean Air Act claims against CEMEX California Cement LLC with respect to the company’s Victorville, Calif., Portland cement plant.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>The settlement will resolve claims asserted in a 2007 complaint that CEMEX is releasing pollutants to the air, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, without required permits setting emission limits under the Clean Air Act.&nbsp; Under the terms of the settlement, CEMEX must meet new limits for these pollutants at the Victorville plant, one of the largest cement plants in the United States, including stringent new limits for nitrogen oxide that will reduce emissions by 1,890 tons per year, a nearly 40 percent reduction.&nbsp; The cement manufacturer must also pay a $2 million civil penalty.&nbsp; EPA estimates that achieving and maintaining compliance with the new emission limits, depending on the control technology used, could cost CEMEX millions of dollars.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>“Today’s settlement shows the federal government’s continued commitment to enforcing the federal environmental laws and protecting the nation’s air quality,” said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>“This settlement will result in cleaner air for California,” said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA’s Air Division in the Pacific Southwest region.&nbsp; “This facility is the largest source of nitrogen oxide—an air pollutant that causes smog—in California, so the state-of-the-art air pollution controls that CEMEX is installing will have a significant impact on air quality.”<\/p>\\n\\n<p>The settlement resolves the EPA’s claims that on two separate occasions, in 1997 and 2000, CEMEX violated the Clean Air Act by undertaking major plant modifications resulting in significant increases in the Victorville plant’s capacity to pollute without first undergoing required regulatory review or obtaining required permits under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, program and without installing state-of-the-art emission controls that would reduce contaminants such as nitrogen oxide.&nbsp;<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Nitrogen oxide is a harmful air pollutant that causes smog and leads to respiratory problems in children and the elderly.&nbsp; The Victorville area fails to meet federal air quality standards for both ozone and particulate matter.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.&nbsp;

The agreement follows the Department’s investigation of the facility, which found substantial civil rights violations.<\/p>    <p>  \"I appreciate King County’s cooperation during our investigation and commend the leadership of the King County Executive and the County Council for their commitment to improve conditions at the jail,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"Today’s agreement will ensure that necessary measures are taken so that the County will meet its obligations under the law.\"<\/p>    <p>  The Department’s investigation identified inadequate medical care and contagious disease prevention and treatment services, inadequate security and detention practices, and inadequate suicide prevention procedures. The agreement requires the implementation of measures to ensure that the identified deficiencies are remedied and that the services and systems to address the inadequate conditions are consistent with constitutional standards.<\/p>    <p>  The Civil Rights Division conducted its investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which authorizes the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations of other adult correctional facilities in numerous other jurisdictions, including Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.<\/p>    <p>  The Department of Justice’s enforcement effort reaches beyond adult correctional facilities. Since 2001, the Department of Justice has opened 97 similar investigations into conditions of confinement at correctional facilities, juvenile detention centers, nursing homes, mental health facilities and residences for persons with developmental disabilities throughout the United States.<\/p>    <p>  More information about the Special Litigation Section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division can be found at <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/index.html\">  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">    <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">  http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/index.html<\/span><\/span><\/a>.<\/p> #> 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>  WASHINGTON – The owners and operators of two Miami medical clinics, along with a phlebotomist at one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced today.<\/p>    <p>  <\/p>    <p>  Juan A. \"Tony\" Marrero, 41, Belkis Marrero, 41, and Luz Borrego, 43, each pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2009, to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in the Southern District of Florida. In their pleas, Tony and Belkis Marrero admitted that they co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;P).<\/p>    <p>  Medcore and M&amp;P purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. The Marreros admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 they conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Borrego acknowledged her role in the fraud at Medcore where she was a phlebotomist who administered unnecessary drugs intravenously to HIV patients. Tony Marrero also pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracies to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud. Sentencing for all three defendants is scheduled for April 3, 2009.<\/p>    <p>  During their pleas, the defendants admitted that Medcore and M&amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare and that the treatments for infused or injected drugs billed to Medicare were not medically necessary. Each of the defendants also admitted that all of the patients at the clinics were participants in the fraud. The defendants admitted that they, or their co-conspirators, entered into kickback arrangements with these Medicare beneficiaries whereby the beneficiaries were paid every week in exchange for their Medicare billing information, which allowed the clinics to submit the fraudulent bills.<\/p>    <p>  To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Tony Marrero admitted that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.<\/p>    <p>  The defendants admitted that none of the Medicare beneficiaries needed the injection and infusion treatments billed to Medicare by the clinics. Tony and Belkis Marrero acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Belkis Marrero and Borrego also admitted that they put together medical files to make them appear legitimate and that they supported the treatments being billed to Medicare.<\/p>    <p>  On Jan. 7, 2009, Orlando Pascual Jr., a co-owner of Medcore and M&amp;P, pleaded guilty to his role in the Medicare fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a separate durable medical equipment company that he operated from 2001 to 2003.<\/p>    <p>  On Jan. 14, 2009, Harold Sio, the owner of pharmaceutical wholesale company named Lifecare Medical, was charged by criminal information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sio, whose company supplied Medcore and M&amp;P with infusible drugs, allegedly conspired with Pascual and Tony Marrero to accomplish the health care fraud scheme by providing false invoices for the drugs allegedly used in the scheme.<\/p>    <p>  Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 9, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment and an information are merely charges, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>    <p>  The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S. (Jay) Darden, and Trial Attorney Charles Reed of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General and the FBI. The case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (MFSF), supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and U.S. Attorney Acosta of the Southern District of Florida. Since the inception of MFSF operations, federal prosecutors have indicted 106 cases with 190 defendants in both Los Angeles and Miami. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for more than half a billion dollars.<\/p> #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           <p>  WASHINGTON - A federal court has ordered CPA Steven W. McCann, who operates a firm called SWMc Services in the Houma, La., area, to stop claiming improper tax deductions on federal income tax returns he prepares for customers, the Justice Department announced today. McCann agreed to the civil injunction order.<\/p>    <p>  According to the <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/txdv081077.htm\">  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">    <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">  government complaint<\/span><\/span><\/a> filed in the case, McCann prepared nearly 1,000 federal income tax returns claiming fraudulent employee expense deductions for customers who work as mariners. The government alleged that these deductions were false because the expenses McCann claimed for his customers were never paid by the clients. Instead, their employers provided the items being deducted, including meals and other incidental expenses.

Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio; and C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).<\/p>    <p>  Zubair Ahmed and his cousin Khaleel Ahmed each pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge James G. Carr in Toledo, Ohio, to a one-count, superseding information charging them with conspiracy to provide material support and resources, including the defendants themselves as personnel, to terrorists in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. Section 2339A. At sentencing, each defendant faces a statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, followed by three years of supervised release.<\/p>    <p>  According to the superseding information and other information entered into the court record today:<\/p>    <p>  The criminal conspiracy involving Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed began no later than April 1, 2004, and continued until their arrests on Feb. 21, 2007. As part of the conspiracy, the defendants made preparations to travel overseas in order to engage in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in either Iraq or Afghanistan. On or about May 21, 2004, the defendants traveled to Cairo, Egypt, with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.<\/p>    <p>  After their return from Egypt, on or about July 4, 2004, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed discussed, sought and received instruction on firearms from another individual in Cleveland. The defendants also sought and discussed training in counter-surveillance techniques and sniper rifles with this individual. Specifically, defendant Zubair Ahmed discussed his desire to learn how to use and move with a .50-caliber machine gun.<\/p>    <p>  As part of the conspiracy, the defendants also communicated with each other using code words and in a foreign language to disguise their preparations and plans to engage in acts abroad that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.<\/p>    <p>  Furthermore, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed researched the purchase of firearms, methods of obtaining firearms instruction (including at least one visit to a firing range) and methods of obtaining instruction in gunsmithing. In addition, the defendants collected and distributed videos of attacks on U.S. military forces overseas, manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry.<\/p>    <p>  \"Today’s guilty pleas should send a strong message to individuals who would use this country as a platform to plot attacks against U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \"This case also underscores the need for continued vigilance in identifying and dismantling extremist plots that develop within our nation.\"<\/p>    <p>  William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said: \"These guilty pleas are testament to the hard work and dedication of all the federal, state and local law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating this case and to the tireless efforts and perseverance of an extremely talented team of federal prosecutors who, with their law enforcement partners, keep this country safe from terrorists.\"<\/p>    <p>  C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division, FBI, said: \"This case is an example of our continued efforts to detect terrorist planning and to prevent acts of terrorism before they occur.&nbsp; Through close cooperation with our law enforcement partners in Illinois and Ohio, this case resulted in the successful prosecution of these individuals.\"<\/p>    <p>  This case was investigated by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Chicago, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio, with the assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Chicago Police Department; the Illinois State Police; the Ohio Highway Patrol; the Toledo Police Department; and the Lucas and Wood County Sheriff’s Departments.&nbsp;<\/p>    <p>  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E. Getz and Justin E. Herdman of the National Security Unit of the U.S Attorney’s Office in Cleveland; as well Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg N. Sofer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Austin, Texas (formerly of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section); and Trial Attorneys Jerome J. Teresinski and Jolie F. Zimmerman of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section.
