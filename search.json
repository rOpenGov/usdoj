Yet language barriers often prevent many communities from understanding their rights, reporting crimes, or otherwise having full and equal access to the Department’s services and resources. The Department’s Equity Action Plan, released earlier this year, focused on improving engagement with stakeholders in underserved communities and disadvantaged groups and reducing language barriers especially for LEP individuals.As a step toward that, today the Department is now releasing the strategic plan in Spanish and key excerpts in the other top languages spoken by the LEP general public in the United States: Chinese (simplified and traditional), Vietnamese, Korean, and Tagalog. The Department continues to prioritize actions to help ensure language access is not a barrier to LEP individuals participation in Department priorities including access to a plan that guides our efforts across the Department as we continue to fulfill our responsibilities to the American people.For more information on our efforts to uphold the rule of law, to keep our country safe, and to protect civil rights, please visit Strategic Plan-Multilingual Versions. #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   From September 19 to 29, 2022, ICITAP-Philippines delivered three 3-day iterations of Best Practices in High Security &amp; Terrorist Detainee Prison Management training, to members of the Philippines Bureau of Jail Management and Penology (BJMP) as well as leadership of the BJMP Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism (P/CVE) Center and Directorate of Intelligence. The training instruction was conducted by three terrorism and P/CVE subject matter experts and ICITAP-Philippines’ Senior Corrections Advisor. Training topics included a range of instruction specific to understanding the current threat of terrorism in the South Asia region, best practices in terrorist detainee assessment, evaluation, categorization and classification, case management, ethical leadership, and intelligence unit familiarization. The instructors also led the students through several scenario-based problem-solving sessions that challenged the members of BJMP, to apply their training to resolve the scenarios they were presented. Class participation was consistently enthusiastic and clearly demonstrated each class’s desire to learn and understand the proper application of the lessons learned.  The back-to-back training approach was designed around BJMP’s work duty assignments, to ensure the training of 84 staff members of BJMP in a timely manner. This is part of a U.S. State Department Counterterrorism Bureau-funded initiative. #> 3 As the fiscal year draws to a close, the Office of Information Policy (OIP) looks to the beginning of the FOIA

Exemption 3 resources, aimed at assisting agencies in their administration of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and increasing public understanding of the use of Exemption 3.  These materials are located on the FOIA Resources page of OIP's site. The first resource is an updated list of Statutes Found to Qualify Under Exemption 3 of the FOIA.  This resource contains the most current listing of federal statutes that federal courts have affirmatively found to qualify as Exemption 3 statutes.  The second resource is the Fiscal Year 2021 list of Statutes used in Annual FOIA Reports in conjunction with Exemption 3 of the FOIA.  This resource includes a listing of the statutes used by all federal agencies subject to the FOIA, as reported in their FY 2021 Annual FOIA Reports.  CSV and PDF versions of this resource provide the citation of each statute used, the type of information protected by the statute, the agencies that cited each statute, and the number of times the statute was cited during the preceding fiscal year.  Charts dating back to FY 2010 are also available on OIP's FOIA Resources page. Agencies that have any questions regarding Exemption 3 statutes, affiliated court decisions, or a statute's impact on FOIA administration may reach out to OIP for advice through the FOIA Counselor Service by calling (202) 514-FOIA (3642).  To receive additional information

Investigation Development Project collaborated with the Office of Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT) to provide the seventh in a series of regional TIP Workshops focusing on Victim Restitution and Assistance.  The workshop was held in Seminyak, Bali Province, and included ten police investigators and ten regional prosecutors.  Presenters included representatives from ICITAP, OPDAT, the Indonesian National Police (INP) District Office in Bali, the High Prosecutor's Office in Bali, INP Headquarters in Jakarta, the Indonesia Attorney General's Office in Jakarta, the Indonesia Victim &amp; Witness Protection Agency, and the United Nations International Organization for Migration. Opening remarks were provided by the Head of the Denpasar District Prosecutor's Office and by the Deputy Head of the General Crimes Directorate from the INP District Office in Bali.  The timing of this workshop is pertinent because Bali will host the International G20 Summit in November 2022, an event expected to generate a sharp increase in human sex trafficking.  This event was delivered with support of and in coordination with the State Department’s Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    MARTIN ESTRADA SWORN IN AS UNITED STATES ATTORNEY      On September 19, Martin Estrada was sworn in as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California by Chief United States District Judge Philip S.

Public Information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and proceedings <\/p> <p>(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows: <\/p> <p>(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions; <\/p><p>(B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available; <\/p> <p>(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations; <\/p> <p>(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and <\/p> <p>(E) each amendment, revision or repeal of the foregoing. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof, a person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be adversely affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal Register and not so published. For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. <\/p><p>(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases[;], <em>if the final opinions or orders are cited, used, or relied on as precedent by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p>(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; and <\/p> <p>(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public; <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. To the extent required to prevent a<em>n<\/em> [clearly] unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction. However, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made available or published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency only if-- <\/p><blockquote>   <blockquote> <p>(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or <\/p> <p>(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote><p>(3)<em>(A)<\/em> Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request <em>by any United States person<\/em> for records which [(A)] <em>(i)<\/em> reasonably describes such records and [(B)] <em>(ii)<\/em> is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to [any person] <em>the requester.<\/em> <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) A requester shall not make or maintain a request under this paragraph for records relating to the subject matter of an  ongoing judicial or adjudicatory administrative proceeding (civil or criminal) to which the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in making the request, is a party <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) An agency may require by regulation that each request for records under this section include declarations by the requester that the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in  making the request, is: <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a United States person as defined in this section, and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) not barred by subsection (a) (3) (B) from making the request. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>A request that does not comply with any such regulation requirement is not a proper request under this section. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(4) (A) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying a uniform schedule of fees applicable to all constituent units of such agency. <em>The schedule may provide for the payment of all costs reasonably attributable to responding to the request, including the costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.<\/em> [Such fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication and provide for recovery of only the direct costs of such search and duplication.] <em>If the requested records contain commercially valuable technological or reference information, generated or acquired by the government at substantial cost to the public, fees may be charged which reflect the fair market value or royalties or both, in addition to or in lieu of any processing fees otherwise chargeable, taking into account such factors as the estimated commercial value of the information, its cost to the government, and any public interest served by its disclosure<\/em>. Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where the agency determines, <em>in the exercise of its discretion,<\/em> that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying  procedures by which--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a submitter may be required to designate, at the time of submission, any information consisting of trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information, which is exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4);<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency shall notify the submitter that a request has been made for information provided by the submitter within a reasonable time prior to a decision to release any such information;<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the submitter may, within 10 working day of the forwarding of such notification, submit to the agency written objection to such disclosure specifying all grounds upon which it is contended that the information should not be disclosed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the agency shall notify the submitter of any final decision to release such information.<\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(C) An agency is not required to notify a submitter pursuant to subparagraph (B) if-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) the information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with agency regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (4)(B)(i), if such designation is required by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency determines, prior to giving such notice, that the request should be denied; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the disclosure is required by law (other than this section); or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(D) If a submitter has objected pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), to disclosure of information that the agency determines to be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4), the agency shall not release such information unless the agency determines in writing that the failure to disclose the records would injure an overriding public interest and disclosure is not otherwise prohibited by law<\/em>. <\/p> <p>[(B)]<em> (E)<\/em> On complaint<em> filed by a requester within 90 days from the date of final agency action or by a submitter prior to the release of submitted information,<\/em> the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has jurisdiction--<\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i)<\/em> to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from [the complainant.] <em>the requester; or  <p>(ii) to enjoin the agency from any disclosure of records which was objected to by a submitter under subparagraph (B)(iii) or which would have been objected to had notice been given as required by subparagraph (B)(ii). <\/p><\/em> <\/p><\/blockquote> <p><em>(F) In an action based on a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) by a requester, the court shall have jurisdiction over any submitter of information <\/em> <em>contained in the requested records, and any such submitter may intervene as of right in the action; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) by a submitier, the court shall have jurisdiction over any requester of records containing information which the submitter seeks to have withheld, and any such requester may intervene as a matter of right in the action. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(G) The agency that is the subject of the complaint shall promptly, upon service of a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) seeking the production of records, notify each submitter of information contained in the requested records that the complaint was filed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) seeking the withholding of records, notify each requester of the records that the complaint was filed. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(H) In any action in which a requester is an intervenor or is joined the court shall on timely motion of the requester transfer the action to a district court which would have had jurisdiction had the action been brought by the requester, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown<\/em>. <\/p> <p><em>(I) In a case in which a record is withheld under subsection (b)(1), the court shall not enjoin the agency from withholding such record unless the agency's action is found to be arbitrary or capricious<\/em>. In [such a case] <em>all other cases<\/em>, the court shall determine the matter de novo [,]. [and] <em>The court<\/em> may examine the contents of [such] <em>requested<\/em> agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section [,].

The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies  of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employees or his representative. The  administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends. <\/p> <p>[(G)] <em>(N)<\/em> In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member in every agency proceeding. <\/p><p>(6) (A) Each agency, upon request [for records] made under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection <em>for records which are sufficiently identified and limited that no more than eight working hours of search and review time are required to respond to the request, and which do not contain trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information provided by a submitter<\/em>, shall-- <\/p><blockquote><blockquote> <p>(i) determine within ten <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; and <\/p> <p>(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>[(B) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of the subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days. As used in this subparagraph, \"unusual circumstances\" means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request-- <\/p> <blockquote> <p>(i) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; <\/p> <p>(ii) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or <\/p> <p>(iii) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.] <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (A), each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection shall-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) within thirty working days after the receipt of the request-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) determine whether to comply with such request, in whole or in part, and immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the requester's right to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed one year; and <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(ii) within thirty working days after the receipt of an appeal-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) make a determination of the appeal; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed six months. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p><em>If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the requester of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying the time periods under subparagraph (B).

to amend the Freedom of Information Act continue on Capitol Hill. <\/p> <p>Major highlights of the efforts to amend the FOIA have been the presentation of the Administration's proposal (see pp. 3-8 of <em>FOIA Update<\/em>) by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan C. Rose of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, and subsequent hearings on this proposal (S. 1751/H.R. 4805) and on a similar proposal, S. 1730, Senator Orrin G. Hatch's FOIA reform bill. Senator Hatch is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Judiciary   Committee. The Hatch subcommittee has held six hearings on the need for FOIA reform.<\/p> <p>In presenting the Administration's proposal on Oct. 15, Assistant Attorney General Rose declared that the Administration stands \"fully committed to carrying out the philosophy and spirit of the Act.\" <\/p> <p>Rose told the Hatch subcommittee that the Administration is \"concerned that in some instances the Freedom of Information Act has been used in ways that are inconsistent with the original objectives of the Congress.\" These include efforts for disclosures which have \"interfered unduly with proper law enforcement activities and national security functions,\" Rose said. He also pointed to the considerable expense involved in FOIA processing and the diversion of agency resources from program responsibilities. <\/p> <p>The Office of Legal Policy began its comprehensive review of the need for FOIA reform in May of this year by asking federal agencies to comment on problems encountered in administering the FOIA and to recommend specific changes in the law. The Administration's legislative proposal represents a synthesis of these recommendations. <\/p> <p>The Administration's proposal includes two additional exemptions to the existing nine; clarification of several existing exemptions; modifications of provisions to allow for new time limits and fee assessments; additional procedures and protections for business information; and new provisions which would preclude use of the FOIA by persons other than U.S. citizens and by parties to lawsuits who have discovery rights. <\/p> <p>Substantive amendments to the current FOIA exemptions include: <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 1<\/strong>--The standard for judicial review with respect to classified records is proposed to be the \"arbitrary or capricious\" standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 2<\/strong>--The proposal extends confidentiality to manuals and instructions to investigators, inspectors, auditors and negotiators, and also to examination material used in employment, certification or licensing. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 4<\/strong>--The Administration's bill would enlarge the protection accorded business records by providing that such records are exempt if their release \"may impair either the legitimate competitive, financial, or business interests of any person or the government's ability to obtain such information in the future.\" In addition, the bill provides procedures by which submitters of such information may have input into agency disclosure determinations. Finally, courts deciding \"reverse FOIA\" cases would review agency disclosure decisions according to a <em>de novo<\/em> standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 6<\/strong>--The Administration's bill extends personal privacy protection to \"records or information concerning individuals\"; changes the balancing standard from a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" to an \"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\"; and exempts compilations of names and addresses that could be used for solicitation purposes. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 7<\/strong>--The Administration's bill makes the following changes: broadening of the exemption's threshold language; addition of language to ensure that investigatory information related to ongoing investigations is fully protected; protection of information that would \"tend to\" disclose the identity of a confidential source; and modification of existing language to further protect confidential sources. <\/p> <p>The bill would also provide an exemption for material related to investigations of terrorism, organized crime or foreign counterintelligence, where designated by the Attorney General. <\/p> <p>Two additional exemptions would allow agencies to protect records generated in settlement of a legal action and technical data which may not be exported outside of the United States without agency approval. <\/p> <p>The bill also provides for two new standards for assessing fees. The first one authorizes fees for the full costs attributable to the processing of requested records. The second permits assessments which reflect the true value of valuable technological or reference information. <\/p> <p>On the problem of time limits, the administration proposal would retain the 10-day time limits for material which can be processed without complication in eight working hours or less. Agencies could take up to a year to respond to more complex or voluminous requests and requests where the interests of a submitter are involved, but would have to provide a specific time estimate and explanation within 10 working days of receipt. <\/p> <p>The Administration bill also addresses the problem of the use of FOIA for discovery purposes by prohibiting a party to a judicial or administrative proceeding from filing a FOIA request for records relating to he subject matter of the proceeding. <\/p> <p>Consideration of the Administration's package and of S. 1730 continued in the Senate Subcommittee on he Constitution during November.<\/p> <p>Rep. Glenn English, chairman of he House Subcommittee on Government Information and Individual Rights, also has held hearings on the Freedom of Information Act and has indicated that he will consider further hearings and markup of a bill after the Senate takes action. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #> 4

            <strong>FOIA Update <br />Vol. III, No. 1 <br />1981<\/strong>    <h2>Recordkeeping Procedures Examined<\/h2>  <p>With few exceptions, records in the physical possession of a federal agency are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. <\/p> <p>Agencies do not, however, have to retain indefinitely all records which are created by or submitted to them. Under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3102 and § 3103, agencies are required to establish records management programs which identify records that should be preserved and to plan for the storage and disposal of records having only temporary significance. <\/p> <p>It is estimated that only about five percent of government records, because of their administrative, legal, research or other value, become part of the permanent national collection. For a variety of reasons, many more records are retained for longer periods of time than are required. <\/p> <p>In addition, some materials can be returned to submitters in the private sector, because of the circumstances under which they were obtained, once there is no longer a need for them. Agencies should be aware that once a Freedom of Information Act request has been received, the requested records assume a special status and ordinarily must be retained until the requester's access rights are determined. <\/p> <p>Federal records, generally speaking, fall into two categories: administrative materials which are standard throughout the entire government and for which there is a schedule for retention and disposition furnished by the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), and other materials which are related to the kinds of programs conducted by the individual agencies. Individual schedules for retention and final disposition of records are developed by agency personnel in consultation with the Archivist of the United States. <\/p>    <strong>The Justice Effort <\/strong>  <p>At the Justice Department, there is a full scale effort underway to help managers and clerical workers focus on files maintenance and records disposition practices. Under the guidance of Bernie Berglind of the Justice Management Division's Records and Publications Staff, a course in files maintenance and records disposition will be given five times in 1982, beginning with a class Jan. 5-6. <\/p> <p>In the course, Berglind points out that almost every move made in government generates paperwork. Some of this material--for example, reading files, informational copies and acknowledgments--need not be kept. Other routine material need not be kept for as long as some offices may keep it. In fact, a significant portion is covered by the routine retention and disposal schedule. <\/p>    <strong>At the FAA <\/strong>  <p>Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reviewed a great deal of material in the complex process of certifying the airworthiness of airplanes and the safety of parts and modifications. <\/p> <p>At first, the FAA took the position that this material -- called Type Design    Data -- was the sort of \"agency records\" required to be retained.    Although this information was generally thought to be in large part protected    under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, it was often sought by tort litigants involved    in suits against both large and small manufacturers. \"A classic use of    the FOIA in place of discovery,\" notes John Walsh, chief of the General    Law Branch, FAA. <\/p> <p>Then came two Supreme Court decisions clarifying what constitutes an \"agency record\" under the FOIA. \"Two recent Supreme Court decisions establish that the Government has no obligation, and perhaps no right, to consider manufacturers' technical data not in its possession to be agency records covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.<em> Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press<\/em>, 445 U.S. 136 (1980); <em>Forsham v. Harris<\/em>, 445 U.S. 169 (1980),\" Walsh noted in a memo. <\/p> <p>He then concluded that technical data which \"never physically reaches FAA premises because it is examined by designees of the Administrator is not 'obtained' by the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA.\" <\/p> <p>Further, \"technical data which has been returned by the FAA to the manufacturer before a FOIA request for it is received, because the FAA has no current need for it, is not in the possession or control of the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA . . .\"<\/p> <p>The FAA's new policy includes an agreement with the manufacturers that secures the records should a court disagree with agency policy or should there be some question as to the business future of a manufacturer. <\/p>    <strong>The Antitrust Division <\/strong>  <p>The Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission follow similar procedures related to return of materials. <\/p> <p>At the Antitrust Division, there is a long-standing practice of returning documents submitted in response to a grand jury subpoena or a civil investigative demand, once the investigation is completed. Rules for limiting the retention of these documents are spelled out in a Division Directive dated Dec. 18, 1980. <\/p> <p>For case law authorizing the practice of returning subpoenaed documents see <em>Application of Bendix Aviation Corp.<\/em>, 58 F. Supp. 953 (S.D.N.Y. 1945), and <em>In re Petroleum Industry Investigation<\/em>, 152 F. Supp. 646 (E.D. Va. 1957). <\/p> <p>At the FTC, Jack Schwartz, deputy assistant general counsel, said that the 96th Congress, apparently noting that DOJ's practices seemed to be working, \"in essence required the FTC to adopt a formal practice\" of returning original documents to submitters. The FTC would keep copies, only as needed, Schwartz says. The FTC regulation, adopted in accord with P.L. 96-252, states that \"[A]ny person who has submitted documentary material to the Commission may file a written request for the return of original documents which have not been received into evidence (1) after the close of the proceeding in connection with which the documents were submitted, or (2) when no proceeding in which the material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time . . .\"<\/p> <p>In sum, the timely application of destruction schedules and other record disposition techniques can result in superior records management and less costly FOIA searches.

<br /><\/p><p> <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Worthington Compressors, Inc., et al. v. Costle<\/em>, Nos. 80-1010, 80-1011, 80-1012, 80-1013 (D.C. Cir., Aug. 20, 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in this case expanded the availability of FOIA Exemption 4 by identifying a new factor to be considered when determining if submitted business material is confidential. <\/p> <p>Four manufacturers of portable air compressors who submitted reports on their    products to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were the appellants in    this case. They requested confidential treatment for their information, but    the agency rejected their objections to disclosure on the grounds that the information    could be duplicated by anyone with access to the air compressors through \"reverse    engineering.\" The manufacturers then sought to enjoin release in the district    court. They contended that the information constituted confidential commercial    information and should be withheld under Exemption 4. Further, they alleged    that the reverse engineering which could be undertaken to determine the design    and engineering specifications of their compressors would be so expensive as    to be commercially impracticable. The district court below sustained the agency    and ordered disclosure. <\/p> <p>The court of appeals, however, reversed. In determining whether information    is confidential in Exemption 4 cases, the circuit court said it is proper to    determine \"whether release of the requested information, given its commercial    value to competitors and the cost of acquiring it through other means, will    cause substantial competitive harm to the business that submitted it.\"    Accordingly, the court concluded, consideration should be given to how costly    it would be for a possible competitor to obtain the information through means    other than the FOIA and whether FOIA disclosure would constitute a windfall    to the requester. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Bast v. U.S. Department of Justice<\/em>, Nos. 79-2039, 80-1050    (D.C. Cir., Sept. 10, 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>This case grew out of a hearing in a previous case. Richard Bast, a private    investigator, alleged that U.S. District Judge John Pratt improperly induced    a court reporter to expunge a portion of a hearing transcript in the earlier    case. Bast then requested access to all FBI documents compiled during the investigation    into the allegation. After the FBI released approximately 600 pages of such    documents, Bast brought suit challenging all withholdings. With a few exceptions,    the district court agreed that the remaining documents were exempt from disclosure.  <\/p> <p>On appeal, 12 documents remained at issue. The agency asserted that all of    the withheld material fell within Exemption 7(C) -- the investigatory records    exemption relating to personal privacy. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said    that while Exemption 7(C) affords broad privacy rights to \"suspects, witnesses    and investigators,\" there still must be a case-by-case balancing of privacy    rights against the public interest in disclosure. <\/p> <p>After reviewing the documents <em>in camera<\/em> the court decided that, with    one exception, the privacy interest outweighed the public interest. The unique    exception is a three sentence passage containing comments by the judge which    the circuit court found could be interpreted as revealing a bias. \"The    public importance of judicial impartiality outweighs the privacy interest in    this case,\" the court ruled in ordering disclosure of that passage. A petition    for rehearing has been filed by the Department of Justice. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p><strong><em>Brown v. Federal Bureau of Investigation<\/em>, 658 F.2d 71 (2d    Cir. 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>In this case, a convicted kidnapper sought access to detailed information from    FBI files regarding his kidnaping victim. He argued that the victim had waived    her privacy rights by testifying at his trial and that, in any event, he had    an overriding need for the information in order to attack his conviction. The    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the requested information    was properly withheld under Exemption 6 and rejected the plaintiffs arguments.    After finding the requested information to be sufficiently personal to satisfy    the \"similar files\" threshold of Exemption 6, the court of appeals    held that the victim's testimony at the trial did not constitute a waiver of    \"her right to keep private other related matters.\" Most significantly,    the court of appeals found the plaintiff's stated interest in using such information    to obtain a new trial to be \"too uncertain, indirect, and remote\"    to overcome the victim's privacy interests in nondisclosure. (A somewhat contrary    outcome on this latter point was reached by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals    in<em> Ferri v. Bell<\/em>, published at 645 F.2d 1213, earlier this year, but    that decision was vacated on Oct. 23 by the Third Circuit and scheduled for    reargument.) <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <em><\/em>   <strong><em>Radovich v. United States Attorney, District of Maryland<\/em>,    658 F.2d 957 (4th Cir. 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>\"Confidential\" as used in the first clause of Exemption 7(D) does    not mean \"secret;\" rather, it means \"given in confidence\"    or \"in trust,\" the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit made clear    in this case. <\/p> <p>The court below had found that the information sought by the plaintiff in this    case was not protected because it was publicly known that the source had spoken    with government prosecutors. Accordingly, said the district court, the identity    of the source -- an attorney for an individual involved in the criminal investigation    -- was \"neither confidential nor at issue.\" In overruling the district    court, the circuit court of appeals concluded that the first clause of Exemption    7(D) serves to protect the attorney's conversations so long as the information    was given under an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances    where such an assurance could reasonably be assumed. Public knowledge of the    source's identity is irrelevant, the appellate court found. <\/p> <p>The Fourth Circuit also examined the second clause of Exemption 7(D), which    the district court has found likewise inapplicable, and construed it broadly    as well. The circuit court found that Congress intended to protect all of the    information furnished by a confidential source \"in the course of a criminal    investigation, irrespective of whether the information might have been available    from some other source.\" <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #>      changed    created       date teaser #> 1 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 2 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 3 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 4 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 5 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 6 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #>                                                                                            title #> 1 FOIA Update: Text of Freedom of Information Act, Showing Changes Proposed in S. 1751/H.R. 4805 #> 2                                                    FOIA Update: OILP Publishes 1981  Case List #> 3                                                              FOIA Update: FOIA Reform Proposed #> 4                                                       FOIA Update: FOIA Training Opportunities #> 5                                                 FOIA Update: Recordkeeping Procedures Examined #> 6                                                         FOIA Update: Significant New Decisions #>                                                                                                                url #> 1 https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-text-freedom-information-act-showing-changes-proposed-s-1751hr-4805 #> 2                                       https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-oilp-publishes-1981-case-list #> 3                                                https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-reform-proposed #> 4                                      https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-training-opportunities-62 #> 5                                   https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-recordkeeping-procedures-examined #> 6                                        https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-significant-new-decisions-55 #>                                   uuid                                vuuid #> 1 4c7090d2-3e8f-4cc7-8160-2e15a2814090 b5d3e433-c9d2-4e4f-acb2-c2e722852530 #> 2 860458cd-687f-4f47-b844-1cc27d90b430 82035722-4d22-44dc-86b9-3f8c981d2f40 #> 3 bb7edcc0-9bec-4215-a7f7-0120caf14238 db71aa8b-924b-461a-a544-ba5bc1844fb3 #> 4 e2d43e0d-99db-49fb-8ac9-87fa0e526e8d 8ed9c40a-ed7d-4463-affb-7c03f100037a #> 5 e7024fa1-22a1-49f0-80ae-5e563fcd94b3 cd549f68-a8b5-4d3a-9846-928bd48300db #> 6 cee7fff5-c6e2-405e-b047-1b318edfe166 2a4fb4f5-fadd-4ddb-8678-2b2fddb43126 #>                           name #> 1 Office of Information Policy #> 2 Office of Information Policy #> 3 Office of Information Policy #> 4 Office of Information Policy #> 5 Office of Information Policy #> 6 Office of Information Policy"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"accessing U.S. Department Justice (DOJ) open data press releases.","code":""},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"","code":"doj_press_releases(     n_results = 50,     search_direction = \"DESC\",     keyword = NULL,     clean = TRUE   )"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"n_results number results return. default, 50 results returned. search_direction Set ASC DESC fetch data starting least recent entries. default, data sorted descending order (recent entries). keyword return results containing keyword.

followed by lifetime supervised release by Judge Timothy M. Burgess on Tuesday, March 28. John Daniel Brooks had previously pleaded guilty to one count of Distribution and Receipt of Child Pornography.In September of 2021, the State of Alaska contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Anchorage to report that a state employee was suspected of possessing images depicting child sexual exploitation. Two days later, the FBI conducted a search warrant at Brooks’ residence, where he worked for the state of Alaska remotely as an analyst programmer.The FBI discovered that Brooks had installed an internal hard drive in his State of Alaska computer that was found to contain over 1.2 million images of suspected child exploitation. Those images included depictions of infants and toddlers being tortured and sexually assaulted by adults. All told, Brooks’ collection of child exploitation materials was one of the largest encountered to date by the FBI in Alaska.“Large scale consumers of child sexual abuse materials like Mr. Brooks directly contribute to the exploitation of children worldwide,” said U.S. Attorney S. Lane Tucker, District of Alaska. “The sentence imposed by the court reflects the seriousness of this type of abhorrent behavior and we will continue to prosecute these cases to the fullest extent of the law. Thanks to the hard work of the FBI and APD, in coordination with our State partners, Mr. Brooks has been brought to justice.”“Our investigation revealed Mr. Brooks acquired and possessed one of the largest collections of child sexual abuse materials found in Alaska,” said Special Agent in Charge Antony Jung of the FBI Anchorage Field Office. “Possession of this material is not a victimless crime, and the FBI will use every legal authority we have to root out predators to protect children from these unconscionable offenses.”The United States Attorney’s Office thanks the State of Alaska. The FBI Anchorage Field Office and the Anchorage Police Department investigated this case as part of the FBI’s Crimes Against Children and Human Trafficking Task Force.This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorney’s Offices nationwide and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

O’Shea, United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, announced that Mario Johnson, 38, Madison, Wisconsin, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge William M. Conley to 60 months in federal prison for distributing 50 grams or more of methamphetamine.  Johnson pleaded guilty to this charge on September 14, 2022.From May 2021 to August 2021, law enforcement agents conducted four controlled buys of methamphetamine from Johnson.  The combined amount of methamphetamine from these controlled buys totaled over one pound. During the sentencing hearing, Judge Conley stated that Johnson had become involved in “serious drug dealing” for financial reasons and took note of Johnson’s prior criminal history, which included domestic abuse offenses.  Ultimately, Judge Conley imposed a 60-month prison term followed by a four-year term of supervised release.  He urged Johnson to use his time in prison to seek programming for his mental health, substance abuse, and anger management issues.The charge against Johnson was the result of an investigation conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Dane County Narcotics Task Force, Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Sun Prairie Police Department.  The investigation was conducted and funded by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), a multi-agency task force that coordinates long-term narcotics trafficking investigations.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron Wegner and Anita Marie Boor prosecuted this case. #> 3

Ohio – Timothy Jefferson, 46, of Butler Township, pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court to drug and gun crimes that carry a mandatory minimum of 15 years and up to life in federal prison. Specifically, Jefferson pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess with intent to distribute amounts of cocaine, methamphetamine and fentanyl that carry a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years and up to life in prison. The defendant also admitted to possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking, a crime that carries a mandatory sentence of five years in prison consecutive to any other penalty. According to court documents, from at least May 2021 until December 2021, Jefferson obtained bulk amounts of cocaine, fentanyl and methamphetamine for resale and distribution in the greater Dayton area. Jefferson and others would travel out-of-state to receive the bulk amounts of narcotics, driving the drugs back to Southern Ohio and staying in hotels along the way. Jefferson’s plea details that he conspired to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, 500 grams or more of methamphetamine and 40 grams or more of fentanyl.          Jefferson kept firearms to protect the illegal drugs and the subsequent drug proceeds. As part of his conviction, Jefferson will forfeit three firearms, multiple rounds of ammunition, a Chevy El Camino and more than $55,000 in cash. Congress sets the mandatory and maximum statutory sentences. Sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the Court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors at a hearing at a later date. Kenneth L.

Assistant United States Attorney Amy M. Smith is representing the United States in this case. # # # #> 4 One defendant pleaded guilty on March 27 in an international fraud scheme that preyed on elderly Americans, and the lead defendant in the case was extradited from Spain yesterday in connection with the same scheme.Ezennia Peter Neboh, 48, of Madrid, Spain, made his initial appearance in Miami today to face federal charges. Neboh, and his co-defendants, Kennedy Ikponmwosa, 51, and Prince Amos Okey Ezemma, 49, also of Madrid; and Iheanyichukwu Jonathan Abraham, 44, Emmanuel Samuel, 39, and Jerry Chucks Ozor, 43, of London, were previously charged in the Southern District of Florida with conspiracy to commit mail fraud as well as counts of mail fraud and wire fraud. Samuel pleaded guilty March 27 in Miami to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.According to court documents, the defendants allegedly operated an inheritance fraud scheme. As part of that scheme, they sent personalized letters to elderly consumers in the United States over the course of more than five years. The letters falsely claimed that the sender was a representative of a bank in Spain and that the recipient was entitled to receive a multimillion-dollar inheritance left for the recipient by a family member who purportedly had died years before in Spain. According to the indictment, the defendants told a series of lies to consumers including that, before they could receive their purported inheritance, they were required to send money for delivery fees, taxes, and payments to avoid questioning from government authorities. The defendants collected money sent in response to the fraudulent letters through a complex web of U.S.-based former victims, whom the defendants convinced to receive money and forward to the defendants or persons associated with them. According to the indictment, victims who sent money never received any purported inheritance funds.  “Schemes that prey on the elderly are particularly insidious,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch will pursue and prosecute transnational criminals who defraud U.S. consumers, wherever they are located. I thank the Kingdom of Spain, including the Spanish National Police and the Ministry of Justice, for their tireless efforts in assisting U.S. authorities to find and arrest these individuals so that they may face charges here in the United States.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long tradition of protecting citizens from these types of schemes and bringing those responsible to justice,” said Postal Inspector in Charge Juan A. Vargas for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Miami Division. “This extradition and guilty plea are a testament of the dedicated partnership between the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, to protect our citizens from these scams.”“We are one step closer to ensuring that those who conned elderly victims for pure financial greed are brought to justice,” said Special Agent in Charge Scott Brown of HSI Arizona. “The recent extradition of one defendant and the guilty plea of another defendant involved in this inheritance fraud scheme demonstrates the commitment of HSI and our law enforcement partners to target offenders wherever they may live and ensure that those offenders answer for their crimes.”According to court documents, Samuel admitted to defrauding over $6 million from more than 400 victims, many of whom he knew were elderly or otherwise vulnerable.  He is scheduled to be sentenced by the Honorable Kathleen M. Williams on June 13, 2023, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. The Consumer Protection Branch, USPIS, and HSI are investigating the case. Senior Trial Attorney Phil Toomajian and Trial Attorneys Josh Rothman and Brianna Gardner of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, Europol, the Spanish National Police, the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency, and the Portuguese Judicial Police all provided critical assistance.The Department urges individuals to be on the lookout for these types of schemes. An inheritance scam is a form of an imposter scam in which fraudsters pretend to be someone they are not, often a lawyer, banker, or foreign official. These fraudsters will try to get people excited about a large windfall and may use legitimate-looking legal documents as part of the scam. Be wary of unexpected contact from individuals offering a large inheritance. Do not send money or provide information to anyone you do not know. Seek advice from a trusted individual or an independent professional if you are in doubt.If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has experienced financial fraud, experienced professionals are standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline: 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311).

Cunha.Court documents allege that Ernest P. Ricci and his wife, Brenda L. Ricci, have been accruing large, outstanding debts to creditors and to the IRS dating back to 2004, and that they have engaged in conduct designed to evade their creditors since 2011. It is alleged that, in October 2017, Ernest Ricci filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition to protect a $1.5 million dollar home in Florida that he and his wife used as both rental property and a vacation home. Bank records indicate that Ricci has failed to make any mortgage payments on the property since at least 2012.Ricci and his wife are alleged to have concealed assets and knowingly made false representations and omissions in filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  Specifically, according to court documents,  Ricci swore under oath that he had been unemployed for many years; that he had no income, no bank accounts, and no assets or properties other than the Florida home; and that he garnered no compensation of any kind from his wife’s company. In those bankruptcy filings, Ricci at first claimed liabilities in excess of $200,000,000 against assets of $1.3 million. He later amended his filings to claim liabilities of more than $2.3 million.In reality, however, it is alleged that Ricci, before filing for bankruptcy, Ricci transferred all the assets of his business: Premier Home Restoration LLC (Premier) in order to shield those assets from his creditors. While Ricci claimed in bankruptcy filings that, following the transfer of the company’s assets, he performed services for Premier without compensation, according to court documents, an investigation determined that, in fact, Ricci continued to control Premier, ran its day-to-day operations, and made use of company financial resources to maintain his lifestyle.  Among other falsehoods, it is alleged that Ricci failed to truthfully disclose his monthly income; rental income from his Florida property and income from property he owned in New Hampshire; failed to disclose an actual Rolex watch as an asset (he allegedly went so far as to produce a fake watch for the Bankruptcy Trustee to examine); and failed to disclose ownership of a boat he was offering for sale as late as February 2023. Additionally, Ernest and Brenda Ricci allegedly falsely claimed, under oath, that Ernest Ricci held a $200,000 mortgage in the name of another person for the New Hampshire property that, in fact, he owned and for which he was collecting rent.It is further alleged that, after the Bankruptcy Trustee was declared to be the equitable owner of Premier, Ernest and Brenda Ricci fraudulently applied for COVID-related Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) from the Small Business Administration, supposedly to pay Premier employees and to company expenses. When filing, they failed to disclose that the Trustee was the owner of Premier, and that they were involved in bankruptcy proceedings.It is alleged that, after fraudulently obtaining the EDIL and PPP funds, Ernest and Brenda Ricci committed money laundering by conducting a series of financial transactions designed to conceal the location, ownership, and control of the PPP and EDIL proceeds, and to use those funds to purchase rental property in Warwick, RI, in the name of another person.Additionally, it is alleged that Ernest Ricci fraudulently applied for and received COVID-related unemployment benefits from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training at the same time he collected approximately $84,370 rental property income from his New Hampshire property.Court documents detail a number of alleged stalling tactics, frivolous pleadings, and fraudulent claims by Ernest Ricci, including claims that he was indigent, during the years’ long bankruptcy proceedings. Documents also detail numerous combative communications allegedly sent by Ernest to the bankruptcy Trustee, some laced with profanities.Ernest and Brenda Ricci were arrested by FBI agents on Friday and charged by way of federal criminal complaints filed by the United States Attorney’s Office.

The sentence was announced by Jason R. Coody, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.“Our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners work tirelessly to keep us safe by removing addictive and deadly controlled substances from our communities,” said U.S. Attorney Coody. “This sentence demonstrates our commitment to support their efforts through the investigation and vigorous prosecution of criminals who would bring drugs into North Florida.”In May 2021, local investigators received information regarding a drug trafficker receiving large quantities of cocaine through the mail from Puerto Rico.  The Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Postal Inspection Service worked in concert with the local investigators to further identify the conspirators and establish a historical record of the cocaine-laded parcels being shipped to Gainesville from Puerto Rico. As a result of the combined investigative efforts, Vega was held accountable for trafficking approximately 129 kilograms of cocaine between 2018 and June 2022. Authorities were able to seize a total of 12 kilograms of cocaine and tens of thousands of dollars over the course of the investigation.“Ridding our communities of this poison and ensuring the safety and health of our citizens is one of DEA’s top priorities,” said DEA Miami Field Division Special Agent in Charge Deanne L. Reuter. “The success of this investigation is a direct result of the tireless efforts of these dedicated investigators and highlights our continued commitment to working with our law enforcement partners to protect our Florida communities.” “We will continue to work with our partners to take deadly drugs off our streets,” said Miami Division U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Inspector in Charge Juan Vargas. “Preventing the use of the nation’s mail system for illegal activities or illicit gains is a primary focus of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.”This case resulted from a joint investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Postal Inspection Service.

Elsey prosecuted the case.The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida is one of 94 offices that serve as the nation’s principal litigators under the direction of the Attorney General.

                             <p>  WASHINGTON   – A federal jury in Jacksonville, Fla., found Paul Tillis, a former Florida Department of Corrections officer, guilty on Jan. 16, 2009, of a felony federal civil rights violation for an August 2005 assault on an inmate.<\/p>    <p>  The evidence at trial showed that on Aug. 14, 2005, Tillis assaulted the victim by pouring a bottle of scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis was on duty as a supervisory corrections officer at the  Florida State Prison in Raiford. During his shift, one of the inmates in his custody allegedly feigned injury by lying on the floor of his cell. In response, the defendant filled a bottle from a nearby dispenser that provided water at near-boiling temperatures, then poured the scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis also failed to arrange for medical treatment for the victim, who suffered second degree burns on his chest as a result of this assault.<\/p>    <p>  \"It is important that corrections officers realize they may not use their positions of authority to inflict physical harm on inmates as punishment,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King for the Civil Rights Division. \"While the vast majority of law enforcement officers carry out their difficult duties in a lawful and professional manner, the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute those who cross the line and commit this type of unlawful act.\"<\/p>    <p>  Tillis faces a maximum punishment of ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled by the court.<\/p>    <p>  This case was investigated by agents from the FBI’s Jacksonville Division and the Florida Office of the Inspector General. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mac Heavener of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida and Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Douglas Kern.<\/p>    <p>  The Civil Rights Division is committed to the vigorous enforcement of every federal criminal civil rights statute, such as those laws that prohibit the willful use of excessive force or other acts of misconduct by law enforcement and other government officials. In FY2008, the Criminal Section filed the largest-ever number of federal criminal civil rights cases in a single year in the Section’s history, and the second-highest ever number of official misconduct prosecutions.<\/p> #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <p>WASHINGTON – Jorge De Castro Font, 45, a former senator in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, pleaded guilty today to 20 counts of honest services wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez announced.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font pleaded guilty to devising and engaging in a scheme that deprived the people of Puerto Rico of his honest services as a legislator, performed free from conflict of interest, concealment and improper influence. De Castro Font also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion through fear of economic harm and under color of official right. De Castro Font was indicted for these and other related offenses on Oct. 2, 2008.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Francisco Augusto Besosa in the District of Puerto Rico. De Castro Font admitted that from Jan. 2, 2005, through August 2008, he directly and indirectly solicited between approximately $500,000 and $525,000 in cash payments and other benefits, such as campaign contributions in excess of the legal limits, lodging, private flights, meals and other things of value, from individuals. De Castro Font admitted that he engaged in official acts on behalf of some of these individuals who had provided him with these undisclosed benefits, including but not limited to, proposing legislation, preventing legislative projects to be voted or acted upon, and persuading other legislators to vote for or against legislation.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font also admitted to participating in a conspiracy to obtain cash and other benefits from five individuals whom he admitted he knew felt that if they did not provide him with the financial benefits requested, De Castro Font could use his official position to harm their financial interests.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Judge Besosa scheduled a sentencing hearing on Apr. 23, 2009.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Using an elected office for personal gain denies citizens the honest services of their elected leaders,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin. \"The Department will continue to identify and prosecute public officials who corruptly use their position and influence to illegally benefit themselves.\"<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Senator De Castro Font has accepted responsibility for the acts of public corruption charged in the indictment. His conduct was an affront to the voters of Puerto Rico who placed their trust and confidence in him and the institution that he represented, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. His blatant disregard for his oath of office and his breach of the public trust, for his personal enrichment, violated the very essence of our democratic government. We will continue our public corruption investigations against public officials and those who make illegal payments in exchange for official acts,\" said U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Let this conviction send a stark message to all public servants that the sale of influence and public corruption will not be tolerated by the FBI or the law-abiding citizens of Puerto Rico,\" said Luis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI-San Juan Field Office.  \"The FBI will continue to be vigilant so as to root out all public corruption.  As I have said before, corruption affects every facet of society: the people, honest businessmen, education and public works.\"<\/p>\\n\\n<p>On Dec. 4, 2008, Alberto Goachet, a political consultant and aide to De Castro Font, pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to launder illegal campaign contributions and other payments.  Goachet admitted that he and others laundered the money through the use of fake invoices purporting to reflect legitimate payments to a political consulting firm owned by Goachet. Goachet admitted that the false invoices were meant to conceal a businessman’s illegal payments to De Castro Font.

Martinez a dos años de libertad bajo supervisión después de haber cumplido su sentencia en prisión, y a entregar $36,375 al gobierno. Perez se declaró culpable el 27 de abril de 2009, de conspirar para realizar pagos corruptos para una compañía de telecomunicaciones del Condado de Miami-Dade a funcionarios de la compañía de telecomunicaciones estatal de la República de Haití, Telecommunications D'Haiti, en violación de la Ley de Prácticas Corruptas en el Extranjero (FCPA) y leyes de lavado de dinero.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>En su declaración de culpabilidad, Perez admitió haber conspirado para realizar pagos corruptos a funcionarios gubernamentales extranjeros con la finalidad de obtener ventajas comerciales para la empresa de telecomunicaciones por parte de Telecommunications D'Haiti. De acuerdo con el expediente judicial, Perez conspiró con Robert Antoine, el ex director de relaciones internacionales para Telecommunications D'Haiti y Juan Diaz, el propietario de J.D. Locator Services, junto con otros. Perez y sus coconspiradores ocultaros los pagos de sobornos en parte al conducir transacciones financieras en las que se realizaron transferencias telegráficas de dinero a empresas fantasma y a través de denominaciones falsas en facturas, cheques y libros contables. Perez admitió que él mismo estuvo involucrado en dos pagos de sobornos por un total de aproximadamente 36,375 dólares.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>El 30 de julio de 2010, Diaz fue sentenciado a 57 meses en prisión después de haberse declarado culpable de pagar y ocultar 1,028,851 dólares en sobornos a ex funcionarios del gobierno de Haití mientras actuaba como intermediario para tres empresas privadas de telecomunicaciones. Antoine admitió que aceptó los sobornos, incluidos sobornos de Diaz, y se declaró culpable el 12 de marzo de 2010 a conspiración para cometer lavado de dinero.

El enjuiciamiento de los demás demandados tiene su inicio programado para el 28 de febrero de 2011 en el Tribunal Federal de Distrito en Miami.

Grant, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office announced.<\/p>    <p>  William Cozzi, 51, pleaded guilty to a one-count information in U.S. District Court in Chicago, admitting he used excessive or unreasonable force while acting under color of law. Cozzi joined the Chicago Police Department in 1992 and was assigned to the 25<sup>th<\/sup> District at the time of the alleged incident. He was subsequently suspended from duty. Cozzi was indicted in April 2008 for depriving the victim of his civil rights.<\/p>    <p>  On Aug. 2, 2005, while performing his duties as a police officer, Cozzi admitted that he used a \"sap,\" a dangerous weapon similar to a blackjack, to repeatedly strike the victim who was handcuffed and shackled in a wheelchair at Norwegian American Hospital, resulting in bodily injury. At the time, the victim was awaiting treatment in the hospital emergency room after being stabbed in the shoulder.<\/p>    <p>  \"The defendant violated the public trust by abusing his law enforcement authority,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King.  \"This prosecution demonstrates that the Civil Rights Division is committed to aggressively prosecuting law enforcement officers who willfully use excessive force.\"<\/p>    <p>  \"No law enforcement officer may use unreasonable force with impunity and every citizen, regardless of being in police custody, has a constitutional right to be free from the use of excessive force,\" U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald said.<\/p>    <p>  Cozzi pleaded guilty while reserving his right to appeal a ruling last year denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the prosecution was based in part on compelled statements he made to the Chicago Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards and during a police review board hearing.<\/p>    <p>  According to a plea agreement, Cozzi was dispatched to the hospital to respond to the stabbing and approached the victim who was being loud and verbally abusive while awaiting treatment for the stabbing. Shortly after approaching the victim, Cozzi placed him in handcuffs and left the emergency room to retrieve leg shackles, which he then placed on the victim. With the victim restrained, Cozzi used a sap to repeatedly strike him in the face and body. According to the plea agreement, at the time of the assault the victim posed no physical threat to Cozzi or anyone else at the hospital.<\/p>    <p>  Cozzi also admitted that he subsequently prepared a false arrest report and misdemeanor complaints stating that the victim attempted to punch him and two hospital security guards, as well as a false tactical response report stating that he used an \"open hand strike\" on the victim but omitted that he struck the victim with a sap.<\/p>    <p>  U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning set sentencing for March 26, 2009. Cozzi faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.<\/p>    <p>  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Drury from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.<\/p> #> 6   <p>  WASHINGTON – Phat Ngoc Tran, 35, pleaded guilty today in San Diego to conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, the \"Tran Organization,\" in a scheme to cheat at least 12 casinos across the United States and Canada out of millions of dollars, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen P. Hewitt for the Southern District of California announced today. Tran admitted that he and his co-conspirators unlawfully obtained up to $2.5 million during card cheats.<\/p>    <p>  A three-count indictment was returned May 22, 2007, and unsealed in the Southern District of California on May 24, 2007, charging Tran and 13 others each with one count of conspiracy to participate in the affairs of a racketeering enterprise; one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The indictment also charged five separate individuals each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.<\/p>    <p>  In his plea agreement, Tran admitted that on numerous occasions between approximately October 2002 and July 2006, he participated in gambling cheats together with other alleged members of the Tran Organization at casinos in the United States and Canada. Tran admitted to targeting at least 12 casinos in the racketeering conspiracy, including:<\/p>  <ul><li>Beau Rivage Casino, in Biloxi, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario, Canada;<\/li>  <li>Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn.;<\/li>  <li>Gold Strike Casino in Tunica, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino, in Bossier City, La.;<\/li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino and Hotel, in Tunica, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Isle of Capri Casino, in Westlake, La.;<\/li>  <li>Majestic Star Casino, in Gary, Ind.;<\/li>  <li>Mohegan Sun Resort Casino, in Uncasville, Conn.;<\/li>  <li>Palace Station Casino, in Las Vegas, Nev.;<\/li>  <li>Resorts East Chicago Hotel and Casino, in East Chicago, Ind.; and <\/li>  <li>Sycuan Casino, in El Cajon, Calif.<\/li>  <\/ul><p>  According to the indictment, the defendants and others executed a \"false shuffle\" cheating scheme at casinos in the United States and Canada during blackjack and mini-baccarat games. The indictment alleges that members of the criminal organization bribed casino card dealers and supervisors to perform false shuffles during card games, thereby creating \"slugs\" or groups, of un-shuffled cards. The indictment also alleges that after tracking the order of cards dealt in a card game, a member of the organization would signal to the card dealer to perform a \"false shuffle,\" and members of the group would then bet on the known order of cards when the slug appeared on the table. By doing so, members of the conspiracy repeatedly won thousands of dollars during card games, including winning up to $868,000 on one occasion.<\/p>    <p>  The indictment also alleges that the members of the organization used sophisticated mechanisms for tracking the order of cards during games, including hidden transmitter devices and specially created software that would predict the order in which cards would reappear during mini-baccarat and blackjack games.<\/p>    <p>  An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>    <p>  Tran’s sentencing is scheduled for June 1, 2009, in San Diego before U.S. District Judge John A. Houston. At sentencing, Tran faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the racketeering conspiracy charge. Tran agreed to a personal money judgment in the amount of $180,000, which will be entered by way of a preliminary order of forfeiture. He also acknowledged that the restitution that he may be ordered to pay by the court at sentencing is not limited by the forfeiture amount. Tran was also charged in Orillia, Ontario, Canada, for his admitted cheating activities at Casino Rama.<\/p>    <p>  A second indictment has alleged that 11 additional defendants conspired to commit offenses on behalf of the Tran Organization. A one-count indictment, unsealed in the Southern District of California on Sept. 11, 2008, charged Bryan Arce; Don Man Duong; Hogan Ho; Thang Viet Huynh; Outtama Keovongsa; Leap Kong, a/k/a Lanida Kong; Qua Le; Khunsela Prom, a/k/a Danny Prom; James Root; Darrell Saicocie; and Dan Thich each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos, and conspiracy to travel in interstate and foreign commerce in aid of racketeering.<\/p>    <p>  To date, 20 defendants, including Tran, have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the casino-cheating conspiracy: Phuong Quoc Truong; Anh Phuong Tran; Martin Lee Aronson; Liem Thanh Lam; George Michael Lee; Tien Duc Vu; Son Hong Johnson; Barry Wellford; Willy Tran; Tuan Mong Le; Duc Cong Nguyen; Han Truong Nguyen; Roderick Vang Thor; Sisouvanh Mounlasy; Navin Nith; Renee Cuc Quang; Ui Suk Weller; Phally Ly; and Khunsela Prom. These defendants admitted to targeting, with the aid of coconspirators, a combined total of approximately 24 casinos during the course of the conspiracy.<\/p>    <p>  The case is being investigated by the FBI’s San Diego Field Office; the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation; the San Diego Sheriff’s Department; and the California Department of Justice’s Bureau of Gambling Control. The investigation has received assistance from federal, state, tribal and foreign authorities, including: the Ontario Provincial Police; the National Indian Gaming Commission; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington; FBI Resident Agencies in Gulfport, Miss., Tacoma, Wash., and Toledo, Ohio; the Indiana State Police; the Rumsey Rancheria Tribal Gaming Agency; the Sycuan Gaming Commission; the Barona Gaming Commission; the Mississippi Gaming Commission; and the Washington State Gambling Commission.<\/p>    <p>  The prosecution of the case is led by the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section (OCRS). Department of Justice Trial Attorneys Joseph K. Wheatley, Robert S. Tully and Gavin A.

dangerous menace to national security – a double threat posed by a vicious transnational crime group operating from what it thought was the safe haven of a rogue nation.That rogue nation is the Islamic Republic of Iran, an all-too-familiar, repeat violator of human rights.This case began with our investigation of Iran’s efforts to project power and extend its tentacles of oppression onto American shores – through the targeting of an Iranian-American journalist who has stood up to the brutal regime, shining a light on Iran’s abuse of human rights and women’s rights.But this time, it was a newer actor who brought the campaign of violence into America: an Eastern European criminal organization made up of self-described “Oğru,” or thieves, who engaged in extortion, kidnapping, and – in this case –  murder-for-hire.The charges unsealed today show how organized crime, in pursuit of profits and operating from a rogue nation, can pose a grave threat to our national security and to the freedoms that we hold dear.Increasingly, we are seeing national security and criminal threats blend, as rogue nations and criminal organizations make common cause and share capabilities. From ransomware groups targeting critical infrastructure to facilitators of sanctions evasion, these criminal actors embolden our enemies and threaten our national security.All too often, they seek refuge in countries they believe will protect and empower them – in this case, Iran.While they may think they are out of reach, our agents and prosecutors are uniquely equipped to combat this double threat with both law enforcement and national security tools.This case also highlights the evolving threat and increasingly brazen conduct emanating from Iran.I have spoken before about the threat Iran poses to our homeland through its networks and proxies.In the last year, we have charged members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) with a plot to murder the former U.S. National Security Advisor;\\tWe’ve indicted Iranian hackers for targeting utility companies and other critical U.S. infrastructure;\\tAnd we’ve called out Iran for a destructive cyberattack that crippled a partner government’s computer networks.We will not tolerate this belligerent and criminal conduct. Instead, we will hold accountable those who would bring Iran’s campaign of violence to our shores. We will hold accountable those who seek to silence voices for human rights and women’s rights.The charges announced today expose a dangerous – and ultimately thwarted – plot to export violent oppression to America. But today, we have demonstrated the strength and the reach of the Department of Justice and the rule of law.Today’s actions show that the United States will zealously protect freedom and hold accountable all those who would use violence to undermine it. #> 2

       This murder-for-hire plot directed against a prominent critic of the Iranian regime is yet another chilling example of the violent tactics used to silence those who speak out for the freedoms and safety of people around the world.  This is not the first time the Department has disrupted an Iran-based plot against this victim. Last year, DOJ indicted four individuals connected to Iranian intelligence with a kidnapping conspiracy aimed at forcibly returning the victim to Iran. These charges are just the latest example of individuals in Iran directing deadly violence on U.S. soil. Last year, DOJ charged a member of the Iranian IRGC with an attempt to assassinate the former U.S. National Security Advisor.We have the solemn duty to protect the American people from hostile foreign actors who would seek to harm them. Increasingly, authoritarian regimes engage in and support wide-ranging efforts to undermine our core values and the rule of law.  We face an alarming rise in plots emanating from Iran, China, Russia, and elsewhere, targeting people in the United States, often using criminal proxies and cutouts.The Department remains steadfast in our determination to defend our fundamental American values of freedom of expression in the face of all forms of transnational repression. To foreign actors who plot violence on our soil believing they are out of our reach, know that we will pursue you, wherever you may be.The lead defendant in this case was a made member of a criminal organization living in Iran, who believed he could get away with plotting to kill an American in New York City. Now, he will face justice in a U.S. courtroom.This is because of the dedication and partnership of the FBI, the U.S. Attorney’s Office, and the National Security Division, who are working every day to defend our nation’s security. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Remarks as DeliveredGood afternoon.  Thank you, Kris, for that very kind introduction. Today we recognize National Human Trafficking Prevention Month. And we recognize 20 years of anti-trafficking programs by the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime.Human trafficking is a heinous crime with devastating consequences.Traffickers prey upon the most vulnerable members of our society.They exploit and control their victims, often through force, violence, or abuse.And victims experience unimaginable harm, trauma, and stigma – all of which can prevent them from receiving the support they need and deserve.The Department of Justice is committed to combatting human trafficking from every angle, and to vindicating the rights of victims and survivors.We are committed to expanding our capacity to prevent human trafficking, including by working with federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners.We are committed to expanding our capacity to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking crimes across all 94 of our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices.Prosecutors in our Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit work closely with AUSAs and law enforcement agencies to streamline investigations, ensure consistent application of trafficking statutes, and identify multijurisdictional trafficking networks. In addition, in June 2021, I established Joint Task Force Alpha in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security. The Task Force’s mission is to work within the United States and with our foreign partners in the Northern Triangle and Mexico to dismantle the most dangerous human smuggling and human trafficking networks. The Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section helps lead and has numerous federal prosecutors assigned to the  Task Force. We also are committed to providing protection and trauma-informed assistance to victims and survivors of human trafficking.For two decades, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime has led our efforts to protect and support survivors.In that time, this work has greatly expanded. In 2003, we issued almost $10 million in grants to combat human trafficking. By 2022, we issued more than $90 million. And that figure will grow even more in the year ahead, with up to $95 million in awards available. I am proud that the funding OVC manages is the largest amount of federal funding dedicated to supporting survivors of human trafficking.This funding is used to support direct services for survivors, including housing, employment, and legal assistance. It also supports multidisciplinary task forces, state-level capacity building, and a range of training and technical assistance – all aimed at combatting human trafficking.Together, these resources help ensure the safety and wellbeing of survivors. These resources empower survivors to help bring their traffickers to justice, including through testimony and victim-impact statements.   And these resources help prevent future crimes. I am grateful to OVC – and to everyone involved in this work – for how much you have done to advance our anti-trafficking efforts thus far. But I am grateful more for how much you will continue to do in the years ahead. Your work has made a real difference in the lives of survivors across the country, and it will continue to do so year in and year out. Building an effective response to human trafficking takes commitment and collaboration at every level of government and beyond. It demands a multi-disciplinary approach, and partnerships between subject-matter experts, law enforcement, and stakeholders. And most important, it requires listening to victims and survivors and incorporating their perspectives into everything that we do. Nearly one year ago, I announced the Department’s National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking.This multi-year framework harnesses our law enforcement, prosecution, and grant-making capabilities to more effectively dismantling trafficking threats. The result is an approach to combating trafficking that puts victims first.And in the last year, we have put these policies into place.In support of the Strategy, we have released an updated version of the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance. This version incorporates enhanced protections and addresses specific considerations for vulnerable victims and members of marginalized communities. We have developed and disseminated expanded training resources for federal prosecutors, to offer strategies for enforcing restitution and forfeiture provisions for human trafficking victims.We have expanded the scope of our Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Human Trafficking, so that this program now covers both emergency and transitional housing.And we have launched an interagency Forced Labor Initiative to enhance the detection, investigation, and prosecution of federal criminal forced labor crimes. This initiative is led by a committee of experts from the FBI, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, and the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security.As I said, these are great strides forward. But there is much more to do. So, as we celebrate our accomplishments over the last 20 years, we will also recommit ourselves to doing this important work.We will continue to bring the full force of the Department to the fight against human trafficking. We will continue to bring traffickers to justice. We will continue to disrupt and dismantle the networks that enable these crimes. And we will continue to show victims, by word and by deed, that we are worthy of their trust.I’m now pleased to turn the podium back over to Kris. #> 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Remarks as DeliveredThank you, Kris, for that introduction and for your leadership, which is so powerful, always. I want to say good afternoon to all of you, to Members of Congress, including Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, and to my DOJ colleagues here and to other esteemed guests.As you all know, human trafficking, be it labor or sex trafficking, feeds on exploitation and often upon members of our communities who are already vulnerable, like unhoused youth, persons without lawful immigration status or those experiencing poverty. Data also suggest that while human trafficking impacts every racial and ethnic group in America, it disproportionately impacts Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color. Victims of human trafficking often face challenges in accessing trauma-informed and culturally responsive assistance and support and may encounter numerous obstacles when accessing justice or services. Human trafficking, with its complex and interlocking issues, demands the best of us and the best from us.It is imperative that we employ victim-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive approaches to this work. Over the years we’ve learned not just the value of this approach, but frankly, the consequence of its failure. Earning the trust of survivors is an important step in detecting trafficking in the first place. Building rapport and engaging with survivors is instrumental to removing barriers that can otherwise prevent survivors from coming forward, accessing services and from potentially participating as witnesses in successful investigations and prosecutions of human trafficking cases. And finally, continued and collaborative engagement with this process and people with lived experiences is fundamental to a holistic and enduring effort to build capacity to respond to human trafficking. Progress is not guaranteed. It is hard-fought, and it is earned by the hard work we — and especially all of you — put in day after day. You all move us towards progress.The Justice Department’s National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking reflects the department’s whole-of-agency approach to ensuring that victims of human trafficking are properly identified and receive the necessary support and services to heal and ultimately, to thrive.Our FBI Crimes Against Children and Human Trafficking Unit partners with a range of federal, state, local and Tribal authorities to identify and investigate these crimes.Our FBI Victim Services Division makes certain that identified victims understand their rights under the Victims Rights and Restitution Act and Crime Victims’ Rights Act and are provided critical services immediately following identification.Our specialized prosecutors in the Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section work with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide to strategically and compassionately prosecute these cases.Our Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section helps recover traffickers’ ill-gotten gains and ensure that survivors receive the mandatory restitution they’re entitled to. They also build affirmative cases against traffickers by identifying money flows and related financial investigative steps to identify the traffickers’ financial networks with a particular focus on money laundering charges.Our Office of Justice Programs provide grants, training, technical assistance, research, statistics, and other resources to improve our capacity to respond to human trafficking.And as you just heard from Kris in her welcome remarks, OVC in particular is spearheading our grant making efforts, making it possible for communities to better serve trafficking survivors.Our Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) funds community-based efforts to address the needs of children and youth victims of sex trafficking. OVW also provides funding to support prevention, intervention, and response activities, including culturally specific supportive services for American Indian and Alaska Native victims of sex trafficking. I am so proud of the work and the progress this department has made and of the transformations in the anti-trafficking field, including many spearheaded by the Office for Victims of Crime.Over the past two decades, the funding and resources provided by OVC to grantees and partners throughout the nation has grown exponentially, as Congress has recognized the vital importance of expanding access to comprehensive victim services. Currently, OVC manages an unprecedented number of anti-trafficking projects and grants, working with an exceptional range of organizations — many of whom are represented actually in this room today — who are providing services to a record number of victims and survivors of human trafficking. The performance data OVC grantees report tells the story of the incredible volume of case management, housing, legal, employment, supportive and mental health services that they have provided. In the most recent reporting period, between July 2021 and June 2022, grantees reported assisting well over 16,000 individuals across the country. That’s a record-high number that reflects both the enormous impact of this funding but really illustrates a mere fraction of the harm that trafficking causes.  So, as everyone has said before me, while we have much to celebrate, we remember and use today to remember that still so much more must be done for the most vulnerable among us. Knowing that you all are committed to doing this work with us a great hope because you are the best of us, and you will move us from progress to promise.  I now have the pleasure of introducing my colleague Kristen Clarke, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, whose lawyers and prosecutor and staff have bene hard at work tacking human trafficking. So, please join me in welcoming AAG Clarke to the podium. Thank you. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryGood afternoon.It is an honor to be here among you all today. Welcome to this anniversary commemoration to reflect on the department’s efforts to advance the nation’s response to human trafficking and for joining us in our enduring cause to help crime survivors find their justice.Thank you, Attorney General Garland, Associate Attorney General Gupta, Assistant Attorney General Clarke, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Solomon, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, colleagues, friends and fellow champions in our cause for joining us today.We observed Dr. King’s birthday earlier this month and it reminded me of his words.“We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always right to do right.”The Department of Justice, through its components, has built a multi-layered and robust response to the crime of human trafficking. Over the course of today’s program, you will hear about how DOJ, along with our federal partners, Congressional champions, stakeholders in the field, grantees and survivors of human trafficking have worked together over the past 20 years to ensure that survivors find healing and justice.OVC first started in the anti-trafficking field in 1998 when we awarded our very first grant with funding from the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA. It wasn’t a lot of money, and you could say what we knew about trafficking at that time wasn’t much more. But we knew there were survivors in need, and that grant provided a path to assist them and a path for OVC to learn.Two years later, with the passage of the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act, we were able to develop, expand, and strengthen services to reach more survivors. And before we knew it, Congress appropriated $10 million dollars to OVC in 2002, and we dug in. The following year, in 2003, we funded the first 12 programs under the Services for Trafficking Victims Discretionary grant program.These programs were comprehensive, inclusive of all victims and all forms of human trafficking, and flexible so that service providers could be responsive to a wide array of needs.This marked the beginning of a new chapter in OVC’s history and an enhanced focus within our organization. Our aim was to raise awareness, identify survivors and connect them to much-needed services. In 2010, OVC partnered with the Bureau of Justice Assistance to begin co-funding what’s known as the Enhanced Collaborative Model to Combat Human Trafficking. These multi-disciplinary task forces use a holistic approach to identify victims of trafficking, address their unique needs, and prosecute cases at the federal, Tribal, state, and local levels.Working with all our partners across the country, we were able to identify strong or promising practices which share in resources such as the Development and Operations Roadmap for Multidisciplinary Anti-Human Trafficking Task Forces;  the Faces of Human Trafficking online video series and most recently our anti-trafficking graphic novels written for young survivors of trafficking to help them navigate the judicial system.Today, all of the Office of Justice Programs’ law enforcement, juvenile justice and victim services human trafficking initiatives are housed within OVC; collaborating and modeling the multi-disciplinary approach we promote in our programs. And we’ve gone from $10 million in 2003 to this year awarding over $90 million in grant funding. Our grantees have gone from serving just over 5,000 clients in 2016 to today serving an unprecedented 16,000 clients based on our most recent reporting period. Our Human Trafficking Division, lead by Brecht Donoghue, and made up of nine dedicated professionals manages approximately 500 grant awards worth $360 million. I know I may be a bit biased, but I believe our Human Trafficking Division is one of the hardest working teams in OJP. I’d like to ask the Human Trafficking Division staff who are here with us today, to stand and be acknowledged.  Now, that is truly something to celebrate.Getting to where we are in our country’s efforts to end human trafficking took all of us. It took the loud voices, the quiet voices, the sometimes shaking but still strong voices. It took the brave voices of those who survived, and those who spoke for the ones who could no longer. Your voices have been lifted up and have shaped what we know today and will form what we learn tomorrow.It took the work of victim service providers and advocates who walked side-by-side with survivors and created programs to meet their needs, wherever they were. Adapting, collaborating, expanding and innovating to make sure no one was left behind but, more importantly, to make certain that everybody was included.It took the work of health care providers who understood the unique physical and mental health care needs these patients often required. Recognizing that providing culturally responsive, patient-centered care is a critical component to meeting survivors where they are.It took the work of dedicated law enforcement officers and prosecutors who were trained in trauma-informed techniques. Knowing that justice may look different for each survivor but that everyone deserves the same access to that justice.It took law makers and appropriators who were open to the idea that combatting and responding to human trafficking is not just a whole of government concept but a whole of society imperative. Appreciating that funding is the lifeblood of these efforts and getting it in the hands of the people doing the work is not only a matter of how, but how fast.As far as we’ve come, and as much as we are here to celebrate the good work that has been done; it’s clear, we have miles to go and work yet to do to end trafficking and provide pathways towards healing. It will take all of us, and it will take all we’ve got.That’s why today we have arranged for you to hear – quoting Dr. King again, the “passionate concern of dedicated individuals” from Department of Justice leadership to pioneers and innovators in the field, to individuals who’ve survived. They’re going to talk about our theme today: Collaboration, Transformation, and Impact, and they are going to talk about how the funding made possible by Congress for services, training and technical assistance, is critical to moving the needle for survivors of human trafficking across the country.With that, it is my distinct honor to introduce our first speaker today. Now, as Attorney General you can imagine there are a few issues that require your time and attention. When it comes to matters that impact people, when it comes to survivors of crime, this Attorney General understands the importance of his presence. This, no doubt, comes from his firsthand experience working with victims of crime as both an AUSA and as the lead prosecutor on the Oklahoma City bombing cases. When you hear him talk about our duty to serve crime victims, you know you are listening to a true champion for justice. We thank you for speaking with us today on this important topic on this important occasion.Distinguished guests, it’s my pleasure to introduce the 86th Attorney General of the United States Merrick Garland. #> 6 Remarks as DeliveredGood afternoon. And welcome to Members of Congress, including Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Attorney General Garland, Associate Attorney General Gupta, all of our esteemed guests. I am honored to join you in celebrating OVC’s tremendous achievements over the past two decades.Human trafficking is often described as a form of modern-day slavery because of the ways it degrades human dignity, erodes inalienable rights and subjects other human beings to a state of servitude. While slaveholders in the 18th and 19th centuries used whips, chains and physical restraints, contemporary trafficking crimes often rely on invisible schemes of deception, debts, threats and insidious forms of psychological manipulation to bind victims to perpetrators.  Traffickers target people of color, people who are experiencing homelessness or are facing substance abuse. They target those who are experiencing trauma from sexual or physical abuse, young people thrown out of their families for identifying as LGBTQ+. Traffickers manipulate individuals with cognitive disabilities, and they prey on persons with limited English proficiency or little access to education, or those who lack of immigration status, who are often unaware of the laws that protect them.Since the Civil Rights Division’s founding 65 years ago, enforcing these prohibitions against involuntary servitude have been a cornerstone of our mission as we’ve worked to uphold otherwise elusive Constitutional promises of freedom and equality. And after the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 expanded the statutory prohibitions and the tools available to the department, the division established a dedicated Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit to consolidate specialized anti-trafficking expertise. The unit has since been widely recognized, both nationally and globally, for advancing victim-centered, trauma-informed anti-trafficking strategies and for leading interagency enforcement initiatives to bring high-impact trafficking prosecutions, in partnership with our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide, in partnership with OVC and with other key anti-trafficking partners throughout the department and beyond. Just to underscore the urgency of this important work to bring traffickers to justice, earlier this week, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia sentenced three defendants to serve time in federal prison for conspiracy to commit forced labor for compelling the domestic labor of a Pakistani woman for 12 years. The defendants compelled the victim to serve the family as a domestic servant, using physical and verbal abuse, restricting her communication with her family back in her home country, confiscating her immigration documents, confiscating her money, threatening to separate her from her children by deporting her to Pakistan and more. They slapped, kicked and pushed the victim, even beat her with wooden board, and on one occasion hog-tied her hands and feet and dragged her down the stairs in front of her children. Last week, in an indictment that was unsealed in the Western District of Wisconsin, we charged a Wisconsin man with one count of labor trafficking for using force, threats of force and coercion to cause an adult woman to engage in forced labor for nearly two years.From the time of OVC’s formation, the division has worked hand-in-hand with OVC and other key partners to seek justice for human trafficking victims. Our work alongside OVC on behalf of trafficking victims and survivors is a natural extension of the division’s core mission of abolishing the legacy of slavery and servitude; upholding the Constitution; and vindicating the rights of the most vulnerable. As we emphasized many years ago when announcing the formation of the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit,“Since the inception of the Civil Rights Division, [it] has led the fight against crimes that perpetuate a legacy of slavery and servitude. Whether these crimes took the form of lynchings and cross-burnings by night, or compelled servitude and bondage by day, they all entrenched a legacy of oppression against vulnerable members of our society. Modern-day slavery has taken on new forms … but the struggle remains the same – to vindicate the rights of marginalized members of our society who would otherwise have no voice, and who would otherwise be denied the guarantees of freedom and liberty that form the core of our Constitution.”Our close collaboration with OVC reflects the recognition that the three pillars of global anti-trafficking efforts — protecting victims, prosecuting perpetrators and preventing proliferation — are inseparable from each other and are all essential to our fight against human trafficking. In order to bring traffickers to justice, we must provide victims the protections they need to safely come forward and speak out against their traffickers. And in order to provide victims and other vulnerable people meaningful protection from trafficking threats, we must not only provide them assistance as they work to reclaim and rebuild their lives; we must also hold the perpetrators accountable for their crimes and dismantle trafficking enterprises so they cannot revert to victimizing others.To give an example of what such accountability looks like, in December, a federal judge sentenced an Alabama trafficker to 60 years in prison and ordered him to pay almost a million dollars in restitution to five victims in a case prosecuted by the department. The trafficker targeted women struggling with substance abuse issues and preyed upon them by increasing their heroin use. Then the trafficker withheld opioids from the victims to induce extremely painful withdrawal sickness and compel them to engage in commercial sex. He beat the women and threatened to send sexually explicit images of them to their families. At trial, the victims testified courageously against the trafficker. The victims remain in recovery to this today, and they are now on the road to reclaiming their lives – thanks in part to the services and support they received. One now works for the organization that helped her, working to aid other victims. And that is the lasting impact of collaboration.So, this work requires strong partnerships, and OVC’s work in funding victim service providers and training task force partners has proven vital to identifying, stabilizing and supporting more survivors than ever before. OVC’s efforts, in collaboration with victim service grantees — including some who are here today — are essential to empowering survivors to speak out against their traffickers, often enabling them to testify as witnesses in criminal cases.In recent years, we’ve also worked closely with OVC to amplify the voices of survivors and incorporate the survivor expertise into our work and into ability to detect, investigate, and prosecute these cases. And we’re grateful for OVC’s role in expanding the ongoing dialogue among survivor-experts, victim specialists and law enforcement as we work to strengthen our collective anti-trafficking work.We know from experience that this collaboration has made a profound difference on victims’ lives. As one survivor said about the experience of working with the department and when writing her victim impact statement, “I thank God that there were noble people like you guys to see that justice is served and there to help us and value us, and thanks to you, I had the strength to write this statement.”We’re honored to take a part in this celebration of OVC, its work and its accomplishments over the past two decades and look forward to building on this partnership and continuing the fight in the road ahead as we work to pursue justice for victims and survivors of human trafficking.Thank you so much. #>      changed    created       date #> 1 2023-01-27 2023-01-27 2023-01-27 #> 2 2023-01-27 2023-01-27 2023-01-27 #> 3 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 4 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 5 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 6 2023-01-27 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     teaser #> 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     <NA> #> 2                                                                 This murder-for-hire plot directed against a prominent critic of the Iranian regime is yet another chilling example of the violent tactics used to silence those who speak out for the freedoms and safety of people around the world.   #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Good afternoon. Thank you, Kris, for that very kind introduction.  #> 4                              Thank you, Kris, for that introduction and for your leadership, which is so powerful, always.
