Opening remarks were provided by the Head of the Denpasar District Prosecutor's Office and by the Deputy Head of the General Crimes Directorate from the INP District Office in Bali.  The timing of this workshop is pertinent because Bali will host the International G20 Summit in November 2022, an event expected to generate a sharp increase in human sex trafficking.  This event was delivered with support of and in coordination with the State Department’s Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     MARTIN ESTRADA SWORN IN AS UNITED STATES ATTORNEY      On September 19, Martin Estrada was sworn in as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California by Chief United States District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez. After being confirmed by the United States Senate on September 13, Mr. Estrada was given a four-year appointment by President Joseph Biden.

There, in addition to representing corporate clients, Estrada handled high-impact pro bono matters in the areas of education, immigration and equal justice. Mr. Estrada graduated with distinction from Stanford Law School and earned his undergraduate degree in history from the University of California, Irvine, where he graduated magna cum laude.

The guidance further explains how agencies should process requests involving Privacy Act records, depending on whether the request is submitted by a first-party requester seeking their own records or a third-party seeking records about another person.  The guidance also addresses other common questions, such as how to handle third-party information within a Privacy Act record and how to report requests involving Privacy Act records in agencies’ Annual FOIA Reports.The topics covered in this guidance are regularly included in OIP’s training on FOIA-Privacy Act Interface.  OIP is also available to answer any questions or provide additional guidance to agencies.  Please contact 202-514-3642 or DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov for assistance. #> 4 The FOIA requires agency Chief FOIA Officers to report to the Attorney General on their performance in implementing the law.  Accordingly, since 2009, the Department of Justice has directed agency Chief FOIA Officers to “review all aspects of their agencies’ FOIA administration” and to report annually to the Department of Justice on the efforts undertaken “to improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their agencies.”  Every year, OIP provides specific guidance to agencies on the content and timing of agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports and today we have issued the guidelines for agency 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports. In their 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports, OIP requires agencies to report steps taken in five key areas of FOIA administration highlighted in the Attorney General’s 2022 FOIA Guidelines:FOIA Leadership and Applying the Presumption of Openness,\\tEnsuring Fair and Effective FOIA Administration,\\tProactive Disclosures,\\tSteps Taken to Greater Utilize Technology; and\\tSteps Taken to Remove Barriers to Access, Improve Timeliness in Responding to Requests, and Reduce Backlogs.The 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Guidelines once again include separate reporting requirements for agencies depending on the number of FOIA requests received in the prior fiscal year.  For 2023, there are two sets of reporting requirements.  Agencies that received 50 requests or less in Fiscal Year 2021 are encouraged to report on any efforts or success stories that are not captured in their Fiscal Year 2022 Annual FOIA Report.  All other agencies receiving more than 50 requests have more extensive reporting requirements. OIP has identified 65 agencies that received more than 50 requests in Fiscal Year 2021. These agencies must submit their draft 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to OIP for review by no later than January 17, 2023.  For the remaining agencies receiving 50 requests or less in Fiscal Year 2021, if they do have information to report, they must provide their reports by no later than February 10, 2023.  A listing of all agencies with a link to their reporting requirements is included at the end of the Guidelines. Additional details on the review and submission process are included in the Guidelines.  OIP will once again host refresher training courses on the preparation of both the 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports and the Fiscal Year 2022 Annual FOIA Reports. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 On September 14, the ICITAP-Bangladesh mission reported on ICITAPs Counter-Wildlife Trafficking (CWT) program, which was honored to be joined on their recent wildlife prosecutions training event held in Sreemangal, Sylhet, Bangladesh by women law enforcement officers from across the Bangladesh Forest Department and Bangladesh Police. The Wildlife Crime Control Unit, Junior Wildlife Scout stated, “This workshop is helping me personally because seeing women speak in public to a large audience with so much confidence is inspiring and something I would like to achieve myself.” The Wildlife Inspector of the Wildlife Crime Control Unit, Bangladesh Forest Department when referring to the presence and participation of the visiting U.S. federal judge and the Assistant District Attorney at the ICITAP CWT event stated, “When I see (them), such successful women, I look at them in surprise and I am inspired to do something.” In yet another highlight, the Additional Superintendent of Police – also a participant at the event – reported to have also received previous support and assistance from the U.S. Government, becoming the first policewoman in Bangladesh to receive SWAT training in the United States. ICITAP’s CWT Program is managed with the support of and in coordination with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). #> 6                                                                                                                                        On September 13, ICITAP’s Assistant Director for ICITAP Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) announced that in July of 2022, the second iteration of the United States Government Women, Peace, and Security Congressional Report was released, showcasing key milestones from participating departments in the first implementation year of the WPS strategy. ICITAP’s Engaging Multinational Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) Program showcased as key implementer in the Department of State’s advancement of women’s recruitment, retention, and professional development in the justice and security sectors. The congressional report included key metrics and status reports from Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Agency for International Development on key activities supporting the WPS strategy. In this report the CT-Funded ICITAP EMPoWER Program’s initiative to provide advanced leadership and tactical trainings for the Commander of the Kenyan All-Female SWAT Team (AFSWAT) during a week-long study tour was highlighted as a key activity in support of the first line of effort (LEO) in the WPS Strategy under the Department of State’s framework. The study tour is highlighted as an activity that supports the preparation and meaningful participation of women around the world in decision-making processes related to conflict and crises. The excerpt from the WPS Congressional Report is as follows: “CT hosted a Kenyan delegation to Washington as part of the “Engaging Multinational Policewomen [on Equality] and Rights” (EMPoWER) program, which is designed to promote the participation of women police in counterterrorism law enforcement efforts. During the week-long study tour, the commander of the Kenyan All-Female Special Weapons and Tactics (AFSWAT) Team, along with senior leadership of the Kenyan Administrative Policy, visited multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies to learn about improving recruitment, training, and mentorship of women police, and strengthening networking and mentorship opportunities.” ICITAP’s EMPoWER program builds the capacity of foreign counterterrorism law enforcement agencies and contributes to the advancement of women in leadership in the justice and security sectors. #>      changed    created

Public Information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and proceedings <\/p> <p>(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows: <\/p> <p>(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions; <\/p><p>(B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available; <\/p> <p>(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations; <\/p> <p>(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and <\/p> <p>(E) each amendment, revision or repeal of the foregoing. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof, a person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be adversely affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal Register and not so published. For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. <\/p><p>(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases[;], <em>if the final opinions or orders are cited, used, or relied on as precedent by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p>(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; and <\/p> <p>(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public; <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. To the extent required to prevent a<em>n<\/em> [clearly] unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction. However, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made available or published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency only if-- <\/p><blockquote>   <blockquote> <p>(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or <\/p> <p>(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote><p>(3)<em>(A)<\/em> Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request <em>by any United States person<\/em> for records which [(A)] <em>(i)<\/em> reasonably describes such records and [(B)] <em>(ii)<\/em> is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to [any person] <em>the requester.<\/em> <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) A requester shall not make or maintain a request under this paragraph for records relating to the subject matter of an  ongoing judicial or adjudicatory administrative proceeding (civil or criminal) to which the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in making the request, is a party <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) An agency may require by regulation that each request for records under this section include declarations by the requester that the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in  making the request, is: <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a United States person as defined in this section, and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) not barred by subsection (a) (3) (B) from making the request. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>A request that does not comply with any such regulation requirement is not a proper request under this section. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(4) (A) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying a uniform schedule of fees applicable to all constituent units of such agency. <em>The schedule may provide for the payment of all costs reasonably attributable to responding to the request, including the costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.<\/em> [Such fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication and provide for recovery of only the direct costs of such search and duplication.] <em>If the requested records contain commercially valuable technological or reference information, generated or acquired by the government at substantial cost to the public, fees may be charged which reflect the fair market value or royalties or both, in addition to or in lieu of any processing fees otherwise chargeable, taking into account such factors as the estimated commercial value of the information, its cost to the government, and any public interest served by its disclosure<\/em>. Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where the agency determines, <em>in the exercise of its discretion,<\/em> that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying  procedures by which--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a submitter may be required to designate, at the time of submission, any information consisting of trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information, which is exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4);<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency shall notify the submitter that a request has been made for information provided by the submitter within a reasonable time prior to a decision to release any such information;<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the submitter may, within 10 working day of the forwarding of such notification, submit to the agency written objection to such disclosure specifying all grounds upon which it is contended that the information should not be disclosed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the agency shall notify the submitter of any final decision to release such information.<\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(C) An agency is not required to notify a submitter pursuant to subparagraph (B) if-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) the information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with agency regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (4)(B)(i), if such designation is required by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency determines, prior to giving such notice, that the request should be denied; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the disclosure is required by law (other than this section); or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(D) If a submitter has objected pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), to disclosure of information that the agency determines to be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4), the agency shall not release such information unless the agency determines in writing that the failure to disclose the records would injure an overriding public interest and disclosure is not otherwise prohibited by law<\/em>. <\/p> <p>[(B)]<em> (E)<\/em> On complaint<em> filed by a requester within 90 days from the date of final agency action or by a submitter prior to the release of submitted information,<\/em> the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has jurisdiction--<\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i)<\/em> to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from [the complainant.] <em>the requester; or  <p>(ii) to enjoin the agency from any disclosure of records which was objected to by a submitter under subparagraph (B)(iii) or which would have been objected to had notice been given as required by subparagraph (B)(ii). <\/p><\/em> <\/p><\/blockquote> <p><em>(F) In an action based on a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) by a requester, the court shall have jurisdiction over any submitter of information <\/em> <em>contained in the requested records, and any such submitter may intervene as of right in the action; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) by a submitier, the court shall have jurisdiction over any requester of records containing information which the submitter seeks to have withheld, and any such requester may intervene as a matter of right in the action. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(G) The agency that is the subject of the complaint shall promptly, upon service of a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) seeking the production of records, notify each submitter of information contained in the requested records that the complaint was filed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) seeking the withholding of records, notify each requester of the records that the complaint was filed. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(H) In any action in which a requester is an intervenor or is joined the court shall on timely motion of the requester transfer the action to a district court which would have had jurisdiction had the action been brought by the requester, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown<\/em>. <\/p> <p><em>(I) In a case in which a record is withheld under subsection (b)(1), the court shall not enjoin the agency from withholding such record unless the agency's action is found to be arbitrary or capricious<\/em>. In [such a case] <em>all other cases<\/em>, the court shall determine the matter de novo [,]. [and] <em>The court<\/em> may examine the contents of [such] <em>requested<\/em> agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section [,].

The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies  of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employees or his representative. The  administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends. <\/p> <p>[(G)] <em>(N)<\/em> In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member in every agency proceeding. <\/p><p>(6) (A) Each agency, upon request [for records] made under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection <em>for records which are sufficiently identified and limited that no more than eight working hours of search and review time are required to respond to the request, and which do not contain trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information provided by a submitter<\/em>, shall-- <\/p><blockquote><blockquote> <p>(i) determine within ten <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; and <\/p> <p>(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>[(B) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of the subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days. As used in this subparagraph, \"unusual circumstances\" means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request-- <\/p> <blockquote> <p>(i) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; <\/p> <p>(ii) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or <\/p> <p>(iii) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.] <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (A), each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection shall-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) within thirty working days after the receipt of the request-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) determine whether to comply with such request, in whole or in part, and immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the requester's right to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed one year; and <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(ii) within thirty working days after the receipt of an appeal-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) make a determination of the appeal; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed six months. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p><em>If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the requester of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying the time periods under subparagraph (B).

to amend the Freedom of Information Act continue on Capitol Hill. <\/p> <p>Major highlights of the efforts to amend the FOIA have been the presentation of the Administration's proposal (see pp. 3-8 of <em>FOIA Update<\/em>) by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan C. Rose of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, and subsequent hearings on this proposal (S. 1751/H.R. 4805) and on a similar proposal, S. 1730, Senator Orrin G. Hatch's FOIA reform bill. Senator Hatch is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Judiciary   Committee. The Hatch subcommittee has held six hearings on the need for FOIA reform.<\/p> <p>In presenting the Administration's proposal on Oct. 15, Assistant Attorney General Rose declared that the Administration stands \"fully committed to carrying out the philosophy and spirit of the Act.\" <\/p> <p>Rose told the Hatch subcommittee that the Administration is \"concerned that in some instances the Freedom of Information Act has been used in ways that are inconsistent with the original objectives of the Congress.\" These include efforts for disclosures which have \"interfered unduly with proper law enforcement activities and national security functions,\" Rose said. He also pointed to the considerable expense involved in FOIA processing and the diversion of agency resources from program responsibilities. <\/p> <p>The Office of Legal Policy began its comprehensive review of the need for FOIA reform in May of this year by asking federal agencies to comment on problems encountered in administering the FOIA and to recommend specific changes in the law. The Administration's legislative proposal represents a synthesis of these recommendations. <\/p> <p>The Administration's proposal includes two additional exemptions to the existing nine; clarification of several existing exemptions; modifications of provisions to allow for new time limits and fee assessments; additional procedures and protections for business information; and new provisions which would preclude use of the FOIA by persons other than U.S. citizens and by parties to lawsuits who have discovery rights. <\/p> <p>Substantive amendments to the current FOIA exemptions include: <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 1<\/strong>--The standard for judicial review with respect to classified records is proposed to be the \"arbitrary or capricious\" standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 2<\/strong>--The proposal extends confidentiality to manuals and instructions to investigators, inspectors, auditors and negotiators, and also to examination material used in employment, certification or licensing. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 4<\/strong>--The Administration's bill would enlarge the protection accorded business records by providing that such records are exempt if their release \"may impair either the legitimate competitive, financial, or business interests of any person or the government's ability to obtain such information in the future.\" In addition, the bill provides procedures by which submitters of such information may have input into agency disclosure determinations. Finally, courts deciding \"reverse FOIA\" cases would review agency disclosure decisions according to a <em>de novo<\/em> standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 6<\/strong>--The Administration's bill extends personal privacy protection to \"records or information concerning individuals\"; changes the balancing standard from a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" to an \"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\"; and exempts compilations of names and addresses that could be used for solicitation purposes. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 7<\/strong>--The Administration's bill makes the following changes: broadening of the exemption's threshold language; addition of language to ensure that investigatory information related to ongoing investigations is fully protected; protection of information that would \"tend to\" disclose the identity of a confidential source; and modification of existing language to further protect confidential sources. <\/p> <p>The bill would also provide an exemption for material related to investigations of terrorism, organized crime or foreign counterintelligence, where designated by the Attorney General. <\/p> <p>Two additional exemptions would allow agencies to protect records generated in settlement of a legal action and technical data which may not be exported outside of the United States without agency approval. <\/p> <p>The bill also provides for two new standards for assessing fees. The first one authorizes fees for the full costs attributable to the processing of requested records. The second permits assessments which reflect the true value of valuable technological or reference information. <\/p> <p>On the problem of time limits, the administration proposal would retain the 10-day time limits for material which can be processed without complication in eight working hours or less. Agencies could take up to a year to respond to more complex or voluminous requests and requests where the interests of a submitter are involved, but would have to provide a specific time estimate and explanation within 10 working days of receipt. <\/p> <p>The Administration bill also addresses the problem of the use of FOIA for discovery purposes by prohibiting a party to a judicial or administrative proceeding from filing a FOIA request for records relating to he subject matter of the proceeding. <\/p> <p>Consideration of the Administration's package and of S. 1730 continued in the Senate Subcommittee on he Constitution during November.<\/p> <p>Rep. Glenn English, chairman of he House Subcommittee on Government Information and Individual Rights, also has held hearings on the Freedom of Information Act and has indicated that he will consider further hearings and markup of a bill after the Senate takes action. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #> 4

            <strong>FOIA Update <br />Vol. III, No. 1 <br />1981<\/strong>    <h2>Recordkeeping Procedures Examined<\/h2>  <p>With few exceptions, records in the physical possession of a federal agency are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. <\/p> <p>Agencies do not, however, have to retain indefinitely all records which are created by or submitted to them. Under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3102 and § 3103, agencies are required to establish records management programs which identify records that should be preserved and to plan for the storage and disposal of records having only temporary significance. <\/p> <p>It is estimated that only about five percent of government records, because of their administrative, legal, research or other value, become part of the permanent national collection. For a variety of reasons, many more records are retained for longer periods of time than are required. <\/p> <p>In addition, some materials can be returned to submitters in the private sector, because of the circumstances under which they were obtained, once there is no longer a need for them. Agencies should be aware that once a Freedom of Information Act request has been received, the requested records assume a special status and ordinarily must be retained until the requester's access rights are determined. <\/p> <p>Federal records, generally speaking, fall into two categories: administrative materials which are standard throughout the entire government and for which there is a schedule for retention and disposition furnished by the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), and other materials which are related to the kinds of programs conducted by the individual agencies. Individual schedules for retention and final disposition of records are developed by agency personnel in consultation with the Archivist of the United States. <\/p>    <strong>The Justice Effort <\/strong>  <p>At the Justice Department, there is a full scale effort underway to help managers and clerical workers focus on files maintenance and records disposition practices. Under the guidance of Bernie Berglind of the Justice Management Division's Records and Publications Staff, a course in files maintenance and records disposition will be given five times in 1982, beginning with a class Jan. 5-6. <\/p> <p>In the course, Berglind points out that almost every move made in government generates paperwork. Some of this material--for example, reading files, informational copies and acknowledgments--need not be kept. Other routine material need not be kept for as long as some offices may keep it. In fact, a significant portion is covered by the routine retention and disposal schedule. <\/p>    <strong>At the FAA <\/strong>  <p>Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reviewed a great deal of material in the complex process of certifying the airworthiness of airplanes and the safety of parts and modifications. <\/p> <p>At first, the FAA took the position that this material -- called Type Design    Data -- was the sort of \"agency records\" required to be retained.    Although this information was generally thought to be in large part protected    under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, it was often sought by tort litigants involved    in suits against both large and small manufacturers. \"A classic use of    the FOIA in place of discovery,\" notes John Walsh, chief of the General    Law Branch, FAA. <\/p> <p>Then came two Supreme Court decisions clarifying what constitutes an \"agency record\" under the FOIA. \"Two recent Supreme Court decisions establish that the Government has no obligation, and perhaps no right, to consider manufacturers' technical data not in its possession to be agency records covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.<em> Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press<\/em>, 445 U.S. 136 (1980); <em>Forsham v. Harris<\/em>, 445 U.S. 169 (1980),\" Walsh noted in a memo. <\/p> <p>He then concluded that technical data which \"never physically reaches FAA premises because it is examined by designees of the Administrator is not 'obtained' by the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA.\" <\/p> <p>Further, \"technical data which has been returned by the FAA to the manufacturer before a FOIA request for it is received, because the FAA has no current need for it, is not in the possession or control of the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA . . .\"<\/p> <p>The FAA's new policy includes an agreement with the manufacturers that secures the records should a court disagree with agency policy or should there be some question as to the business future of a manufacturer. <\/p>    <strong>The Antitrust Division <\/strong>  <p>The Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission follow similar procedures related to return of materials. <\/p> <p>At the Antitrust Division, there is a long-standing practice of returning documents submitted in response to a grand jury subpoena or a civil investigative demand, once the investigation is completed. Rules for limiting the retention of these documents are spelled out in a Division Directive dated Dec. 18, 1980. <\/p> <p>For case law authorizing the practice of returning subpoenaed documents see <em>Application of Bendix Aviation Corp.<\/em>, 58 F. Supp. 953 (S.D.N.Y. 1945), and <em>In re Petroleum Industry Investigation<\/em>, 152 F. Supp. 646 (E.D. Va. 1957). <\/p> <p>At the FTC, Jack Schwartz, deputy assistant general counsel, said that the 96th Congress, apparently noting that DOJ's practices seemed to be working, \"in essence required the FTC to adopt a formal practice\" of returning original documents to submitters. The FTC would keep copies, only as needed, Schwartz says. The FTC regulation, adopted in accord with P.L. 96-252, states that \"[A]ny person who has submitted documentary material to the Commission may file a written request for the return of original documents which have not been received into evidence (1) after the close of the proceeding in connection with which the documents were submitted, or (2) when no proceeding in which the material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time . . .\"<\/p> <p>In sum, the timely application of destruction schedules and other record disposition techniques can result in superior records management and less costly FOIA searches.

<br /><\/p><p> <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Worthington Compressors, Inc., et al. v. Costle<\/em>, Nos. 80-1010, 80-1011, 80-1012, 80-1013 (D.C. Cir., Aug. 20, 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in this case expanded the availability of FOIA Exemption 4 by identifying a new factor to be considered when determining if submitted business material is confidential. <\/p> <p>Four manufacturers of portable air compressors who submitted reports on their    products to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were the appellants in    this case. They requested confidential treatment for their information, but    the agency rejected their objections to disclosure on the grounds that the information    could be duplicated by anyone with access to the air compressors through \"reverse    engineering.\" The manufacturers then sought to enjoin release in the district    court. They contended that the information constituted confidential commercial    information and should be withheld under Exemption 4. Further, they alleged    that the reverse engineering which could be undertaken to determine the design    and engineering specifications of their compressors would be so expensive as    to be commercially impracticable. The district court below sustained the agency    and ordered disclosure. <\/p> <p>The court of appeals, however, reversed. In determining whether information    is confidential in Exemption 4 cases, the circuit court said it is proper to    determine \"whether release of the requested information, given its commercial    value to competitors and the cost of acquiring it through other means, will    cause substantial competitive harm to the business that submitted it.\"    Accordingly, the court concluded, consideration should be given to how costly    it would be for a possible competitor to obtain the information through means    other than the FOIA and whether FOIA disclosure would constitute a windfall    to the requester. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Bast v. U.S. Department of Justice<\/em>, Nos. 79-2039, 80-1050    (D.C. Cir., Sept. 10, 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>This case grew out of a hearing in a previous case. Richard Bast, a private    investigator, alleged that U.S. District Judge John Pratt improperly induced    a court reporter to expunge a portion of a hearing transcript in the earlier    case. Bast then requested access to all FBI documents compiled during the investigation    into the allegation. After the FBI released approximately 600 pages of such    documents, Bast brought suit challenging all withholdings. With a few exceptions,    the district court agreed that the remaining documents were exempt from disclosure.  <\/p> <p>On appeal, 12 documents remained at issue. The agency asserted that all of    the withheld material fell within Exemption 7(C) -- the investigatory records    exemption relating to personal privacy. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said    that while Exemption 7(C) affords broad privacy rights to \"suspects, witnesses    and investigators,\" there still must be a case-by-case balancing of privacy    rights against the public interest in disclosure. <\/p> <p>After reviewing the documents <em>in camera<\/em> the court decided that, with    one exception, the privacy interest outweighed the public interest. The unique    exception is a three sentence passage containing comments by the judge which    the circuit court found could be interpreted as revealing a bias. \"The    public importance of judicial impartiality outweighs the privacy interest in    this case,\" the court ruled in ordering disclosure of that passage. A petition    for rehearing has been filed by the Department of Justice. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p><strong><em>Brown v. Federal Bureau of Investigation<\/em>, 658 F.2d 71 (2d    Cir. 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>In this case, a convicted kidnapper sought access to detailed information from    FBI files regarding his kidnaping victim. He argued that the victim had waived    her privacy rights by testifying at his trial and that, in any event, he had    an overriding need for the information in order to attack his conviction. The    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the requested information    was properly withheld under Exemption 6 and rejected the plaintiffs arguments.    After finding the requested information to be sufficiently personal to satisfy    the \"similar files\" threshold of Exemption 6, the court of appeals    held that the victim's testimony at the trial did not constitute a waiver of    \"her right to keep private other related matters.\" Most significantly,    the court of appeals found the plaintiff's stated interest in using such information    to obtain a new trial to be \"too uncertain, indirect, and remote\"    to overcome the victim's privacy interests in nondisclosure. (A somewhat contrary    outcome on this latter point was reached by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals    in<em> Ferri v. Bell<\/em>, published at 645 F.2d 1213, earlier this year, but    that decision was vacated on Oct. 23 by the Third Circuit and scheduled for    reargument.) <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <em><\/em>   <strong><em>Radovich v. United States Attorney, District of Maryland<\/em>,    658 F.2d 957 (4th Cir. 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>\"Confidential\" as used in the first clause of Exemption 7(D) does    not mean \"secret;\" rather, it means \"given in confidence\"    or \"in trust,\" the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit made clear    in this case. <\/p> <p>The court below had found that the information sought by the plaintiff in this    case was not protected because it was publicly known that the source had spoken    with government prosecutors. Accordingly, said the district court, the identity    of the source -- an attorney for an individual involved in the criminal investigation    -- was \"neither confidential nor at issue.\" In overruling the district    court, the circuit court of appeals concluded that the first clause of Exemption    7(D) serves to protect the attorney's conversations so long as the information    was given under an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances    where such an assurance could reasonably be assumed. Public knowledge of the    source's identity is irrelevant, the appellate court found. <\/p> <p>The Fourth Circuit also examined the second clause of Exemption 7(D), which    the district court has found likewise inapplicable, and construed it broadly    as well. The circuit court found that Congress intended to protect all of the    information furnished by a confidential source \"in the course of a criminal    investigation, irrespective of whether the information might have been available    from some other source.\" <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #>      changed    created       date teaser #> 1 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 2 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 3 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 4 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 5 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 6 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #>                                                                                            title #> 1 FOIA Update: Text of Freedom of Information Act, Showing Changes Proposed in S. 1751/H.R. 4805 #> 2                                                    FOIA Update: OILP Publishes 1981  Case List #> 3                                                              FOIA Update: FOIA Reform Proposed #> 4                                                       FOIA Update: FOIA Training Opportunities #> 5                                                 FOIA Update: Recordkeeping Procedures Examined #> 6                                                         FOIA Update: Significant New Decisions #>                                                                                                                url #> 1 https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-text-freedom-information-act-showing-changes-proposed-s-1751hr-4805 #> 2                                       https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-oilp-publishes-1981-case-list #> 3                                                https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-reform-proposed #> 4                                      https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-training-opportunities-62 #> 5                                   https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-recordkeeping-procedures-examined #> 6                                        https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-significant-new-decisions-55 #>                                   uuid                                vuuid #> 1 4c7090d2-3e8f-4cc7-8160-2e15a2814090 b5d3e433-c9d2-4e4f-acb2-c2e722852530 #> 2 860458cd-687f-4f47-b844-1cc27d90b430 82035722-4d22-44dc-86b9-3f8c981d2f40 #> 3 bb7edcc0-9bec-4215-a7f7-0120caf14238 db71aa8b-924b-461a-a544-ba5bc1844fb3 #> 4 e2d43e0d-99db-49fb-8ac9-87fa0e526e8d 8ed9c40a-ed7d-4463-affb-7c03f100037a #> 5 e7024fa1-22a1-49f0-80ae-5e563fcd94b3 cd549f68-a8b5-4d3a-9846-928bd48300db #> 6 cee7fff5-c6e2-405e-b047-1b318edfe166 2a4fb4f5-fadd-4ddb-8678-2b2fddb43126 #>                           name #> 1 Office of Information Policy #> 2 Office of Information Policy #> 3 Office of Information Policy #> 4 Office of Information Policy #> 5 Office of Information Policy #> 6 Office of Information Policy"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"accessing U.S. Department Justice (DOJ) open data press releases.","code":""},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"","code":"doj_press_releases(     n_results = 50,     search_direction = \"DESC\",     keyword = NULL,     clean = TRUE   )"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"n_results number results return. default, 50 results returned. search_direction Set ASC DESC fetch data starting least recent entries. default, data sorted descending order (recent entries). keyword return results containing keyword.

Sawyer, a former trooper with the South Carolina Highway Patrol, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Charleston, S.C., to using excessive force during an arrest.      During his plea, Sawyer acknowledged that he abused his authority as a law enforcement officer when, on May 26, 2006, he unnecessarily and repeatedly kicked the head and neck area of a man who had been apprehended in Sumter County after a chase on Interstate 95. Sawyer agreed that his conduct violated federal law and the constitutional rights of the arrested man.      \"The overwhelming majority of police officers perform their duties with honor and professionalism,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"However, if an officer commits a criminal act by violating another person’s civil rights, the Justice Department will not hesitate to step in and vigorously enforce the law.\"      \"This is an important case, as the public places great trust in law enforcement to protect and serve them,\" said Walt Wilkins, U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina. \"When an officer violates this oath, and the civil rights of those he encounters, the public’s trust is eroded and fellow officers suffer as a result. We are dedicated to prosecuting those who engage in abusive police conduct, and who tarnish the reputation of the dedicated officers who serve each day with honor and distinction.\"             The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alston C. Badger and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Alan Gray formerly of the Civil Rights Division. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON - Leo Burnett Company, a Chicago advertising firm, has agreed to pay the U.S. $15.5 million to settle allegations that the company submitted false claims to the U.S. Army, the Justice Department announced today. The firm had a contract from 2000 to 2005 with the Army to provide advertising services for the military service’s recruiting mission.      The settlement resolves allegations that Leo Burnett improperly billed the Army while developing the recruiting Web site and for advertising under the \"Army of One\" multimedia advertising campaign. Leo Burnett will make a cash payment of $12.1 million and credit the Army $3.4 million in work performed, but not billed.      \"The Justice Department is committed to vigorously pursuing all those who knowingly submit false claims with respect to military contracts,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division.      The settlement resolves the lawsuit filed on behalf of the U.S. government by former Leo Burnett employees, Greg Hamilton and Michele Casey, who received $2,790,000 as their share of the recovery in the case. Under the False Claims Act, private citizens can bring suit on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery obtained by the government.      The litigation and settlement of this case were conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the Justice Department’s Civil Division.      \"The Pentagon’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service will aggressively pursue allegations of fraud that are perpetrated against the Department of Defense,\" said Sharon Woods, Defense Criminal Investigative Service director.      \"The American people trust us to ensure their tax dollars are spent appropriately and we will continue to aggressively seek out and investigate those who intend to defraud the Army and the American taxpayer,\" said Brigadier General Rodney Johnson, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command.      The case was investigated by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Command - Major Procurement Fraud Unit, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency.      This case was prosecuted as part of a National Procurement Fraud Initiative. In October 2006, the Deputy Attorney General announced the formation of a National Procurement Fraud Task Force designed to promote the early detection, identification, prevention and prosecution of procurement fraud associated with the increase in government contracting activity for national security and other government programs. The Procurement Fraud Task Force is chaired by the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division and includes the Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the FBI, the U.S. Inspectors General community and a number of other federal law enforcement agencies. This case, as well as others brought by members of the task force, demonstrate the Justice Department’s commitment to helping ensure the integrity of the government procurement process. #> 4 WASHINGTON - A former chief operating officer of Investment Properties of America, based in Richmond, Va., pleaded guilty today to conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and to making a material false statement to federal investigators, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Dana Boentefor the Eastern District of Virginia announced.      On July 10, 2008, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Lara Coleman, 40, for her role in a scheme to defraud and obtain millions of dollars in client funds held by the 1031 Tax Group (1031TG), a qualified intermediary company owned by the same person who owned Investment Properties of America.      Coleman, a resident of Houston, entered the guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Richmond before U.S. District Judge Robert E. Payne. Coleman pleaded guilty to one count of the superseding indictment that charged her with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and to a one-count information charging her with making a material false statement to federal investigators.      According to the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman and others used 1031TG and its subsidiaries in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars of client funds by false pretenses. Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code allows investment property owners to defer the capital gains tax that would otherwise be due on properties sold, if the proceeds are used to purchase new property in a specified time frame. To facilitate such exchanges, investment property owners deposit the proceeds from the sale of their property with qualified intermediaries and sign exchange agreements, which include various promises by the qualified intermediaries to clients regarding the safekeeping of exchange funds in trust.      In the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman admitted that 1031TG falsely represented that it would hold client funds solely to complete the clients’ 1031 exchanges. Coleman admitted that after obtaining clients’ exchange proceeds with that false promise, she and others misappropriated approximately $132 million in client funds to support the lavish lifestyle of the owner of 1031TG, pay operating expenses for the owner’s various companies, invest in commercial real estate and purchase additional qualified intermediary companies to obtain access to additional client funds. In addition, Coleman admitted that she lied to federal investigators about statements that she had made in 2006 to internal attorneys for Investment Properties of America about the amount of money that she and others had misappropriated.      Coleman has agreed, under the terms of the plea, to a sentence of 10 years in prison. At sentencing, scheduled for May 1, 2009, she also faces a $500,000 fine. In addition, the indictment seeks forfeiture of all funds and assets owned by Coleman that were derived from or connected to the misappropriation of the approximately $132 million in 1031TG funds.      In related cases, Robert D. Field II and Richard E. Simring have pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to defraud 1031TG customers. Field was the chief financial officer and Simring was the chief legal officer of a holding company that was set up, in part, to oversee both Investment Properties of America and 1031TG, however neither company was ever officially made a subsidiary of the holding company. Both men are also scheduled to be sentenced on May 1, 2009.      This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. Dry for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Brigham Cannon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. This continuing investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service and the FBI. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     WASHINGTON—Tyson Foods Inc. pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Arkansas and agreed to pay the maximum fine for willfully violating worker safety regulations that led to a worker’s death in its River Valley Animal Foods (RVAF) plant in Texarkana, Ark., the Justice Department announced.      According to the information filed along with a plea agreement, Tyson operated several RVAF plants that recycled poultry products into protein and fats for the animal food industry. As part of the rendering process in four of the plants, the company used high-pressure steam processors called hydrolyzers to convert the poultry feather into feather meal.      Decomposition of biological material such as poultry feathers produces hydrogen sulfide gas, an acute-acting toxic substance. Employees at the Tyson facilities often were exposed to the toxic gas when working on or near the hydrolyzers, which required frequent adjustment and replacement.      As of October 2003, corporate safety and regional management were aware that hydrogen sulfide gas was present in the RVAF facilities and three of the four facilities with hydrolizers had taken measures to protect employees from hydrogen sulfide gas near the hydrolyzers. However, Tyson Foods did not take sufficient steps to implement controls or protective equipment to reduce exposure within prescribed limits or provide effective training to employees on hydrogen sulfide gas at the Texarkana facility despite an identical exposure, resulting in hydrogen sulfide poisoning of an RVAF Texarkana employee in March 2002.      As a result, at approximately 1 a.m. on Oct. 10, 2003, RVAF maintenance employee Jason Kelley was overcome with hydrogen sulfide gas while repairing a leak from a hydrolyzer and later died. Another employee and two emergency responders were hospitalized due to exposure during the rescue attempt. Two employees also were treated at the scene.      \"Federal laws require employers to undertake steps that limit exposure to dangerous substances like the gas that killed Jason Kelley. Tyson Foods willfully ignored these regulations and today is being held responsible,\" said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. \"The Justice Department takes its enforcement responsibility seriously and companies that ignore these laws and risk their employees’ lives will be prosecuted.\"      The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requires that employers furnish places of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees. This includes taking steps to ensure that employee exposure to dangerous substances such as hydrogen sulfide gas remains within prescribed limits. Tyson Foods pleaded guilty today to a \"willful violation of an OSHA standard resulting in the death of an employee,\" the most serious offense available to OSHA.      According to today’s plea agreement, Tyson Food has agreed to pay $500,000, the maximum criminal fine. The company also will serve one year probation.      The investigation was conducted by the Department of Labor and prosecuted by the Justice Department's Environmental Crimes Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas under the Environmental Crimes Section’s worker endangerment initiative. #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON – The President’s Corporate Fraud Task Force has been expanded to include six new agencies to help in the focus on mortgage and securitization fraud cases, Deputy Attorney General Mark R. Filip, the Task Force Chairman, announced today.        The Task Force’s expanded roster     includes the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Reserve, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The new member agencies represent a continuing focus by the Task Force to crack down on mortgage fraud, particularly with regard to ongoing investigations into securitization fraud. The additions mark the largest expansion of the Task Force since it was formed in July 2002.        “The Task Force is uniquely suited to providing the kind of thoughtfulness and collaboration that can be invaluable in tackling mortgage fraud at the corporate level, and in trying to analyze whether and when law enforcement action is appropriate,” said Deputy Attorney General Filip. “These new members reflect the breadth and depth of the mortgage crisis that we are now confronting, and the urgency of the task before us.”      In addition to remarks by the Deputy Attorney General, the Task Force was briefed today by representatives from several of the regulatory agencies on their efforts to tackle mortgage fraud and heard from the Special Inspector General of the newly formed TARP.      The Task Force’s current members include the Assistant Attorneys General for the Justice Department’s Civil and Tax Divisions, the Director of the FBI, seven U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury and Labor, and the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Federal Communications Commission, United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.      Since July 2002, the task force has yielded remarkable results with nearly 1,300 corporate fraud convictions to date, including more than 200 chief executive officers and presidents, more than 120 corporate vice presidents, and more than 50 chief financial officers.      President Bush created the President’s Corporate Fraud Task Force on July 9, 2002 to restore public and investor confidence in America’s corporations following a wave of major corporate scandals. Since its inception, the Task Force has compiled a strong record of combating corporate fraud and punishing those who violate the trust of employees and investors. Prosecutors and agency attorneys who are part of the Task Force have brought charges for accounting fraud, securities fraud, insider trading, market manipulation, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, false statements, money laundering, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, stock option backdating and conspiracy, among others.

Payne. Coleman pleaded guilty to one count of the superseding indictment that charged her with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and to a one-count information charging her with making a material false statement to federal investigators.<\/p>    <p>  According to the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman and others used 1031TG and its subsidiaries in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars of client funds by false pretenses. Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code allows investment property owners to defer the capital gains tax that would otherwise be due on properties sold, if the proceeds are used to purchase new property in a specified time frame. To facilitate such exchanges, investment property owners deposit the proceeds from the sale of their property with qualified intermediaries and sign exchange agreements, which include various promises by the qualified intermediaries to clients regarding the safekeeping of exchange funds in trust.<\/p>    <p>  In the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman admitted that 1031TG falsely represented that it would hold client funds solely to complete the clients’ 1031 exchanges. Coleman admitted that after obtaining clients’ exchange proceeds with that false promise, she and others misappropriated approximately $132 million in client funds to support the lavish lifestyle of the owner of 1031TG, pay operating expenses for the owner’s various companies, invest in commercial real estate and purchase additional qualified intermediary companies to obtain access to additional client funds. In addition, Coleman admitted that she lied to federal investigators about statements that she had made in 2006 to internal attorneys for Investment Properties of America about the amount of money that she and others had misappropriated.<\/p>    <p>  Coleman has agreed, under the terms of the plea, to a sentence of 10 years in prison. At sentencing, scheduled for May 1, 2009, she also faces a $500,000 fine. In addition, the indictment seeks forfeiture of all funds and assets owned by Coleman that were derived from or connected to the misappropriation of the approximately $132 million in 1031TG funds.<\/p>    <p>  In related cases, Robert D. Field II and Richard E. Simring have pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to defraud 1031TG customers. Field was the chief financial officer and Simring was the chief legal officer of a holding company that was set up, in part, to oversee both Investment Properties of America and 1031TG, however neither company was ever officially made a subsidiary of the holding company. Both men are also scheduled to be sentenced on May 1, 2009.<\/p>    <p>  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. Dry for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Brigham Cannon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. This continuing investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.<\/p> #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <p>  WASHINGTON—Tyson Foods Inc. pleaded guilty today in U.S. District Court in Arkansas and agreed to pay the maximum fine for willfully violating worker safety regulations that led to a worker’s death in its River Valley Animal Foods (RVAF) plant in Texarkana, Ark., the Justice Department announced.<\/p>    <p>  According to the information filed along with a plea agreement, Tyson operated several RVAF plants that recycled poultry products into protein and fats for the animal food industry. As part of the rendering process in four of the plants, the company used high-pressure steam processors called hydrolyzers to convert the poultry feather into feather meal.<\/p>    <p>  Decomposition of biological material such as poultry feathers produces hydrogen sulfide gas, an acute-acting toxic substance. Employees at the Tyson facilities often were exposed to the toxic gas when working on or near the hydrolyzers, which required frequent adjustment and replacement.<\/p>    <p>  As of October 2003, corporate safety and regional management were aware that hydrogen sulfide gas was present in the RVAF facilities and three of the four facilities with hydrolizers had taken measures to protect employees from hydrogen sulfide gas near the hydrolyzers. However, Tyson Foods did not take sufficient steps to implement controls or protective equipment to reduce exposure within prescribed limits or provide effective training to employees on hydrogen sulfide gas at the Texarkana facility despite an identical exposure, resulting in hydrogen sulfide poisoning of an RVAF Texarkana employee in March 2002.<\/p>    <p>  As a result, at approximately 1 a.m. on Oct. 10, 2003, RVAF maintenance employee Jason Kelley was overcome with hydrogen sulfide gas while repairing a leak from a hydrolyzer and later died. Another employee and two emergency responders were hospitalized due to exposure during the rescue attempt. Two employees also were treated at the scene.<\/p>    <p>  \"Federal laws require employers to undertake steps that limit exposure to dangerous substances like the gas that killed Jason Kelley. Tyson Foods willfully ignored these regulations and today is being held responsible,\" said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. \"The Justice Department takes its enforcement responsibility seriously and companies that ignore these laws and risk their employees’ lives will be prosecuted.\"<\/p>    <p>  The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requires that employers furnish places of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.
