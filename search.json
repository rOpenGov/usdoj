Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the \"Wordly\" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section. The IACP and IMPACT Section annual memberships allow members access to IACP policies, to network, and to gain from emailed policing information including webinars, good practices, and Quarterly IACP IMPACT Section international police Zoom meetings and presentations. Several ICITAP employees and contractors hold key positions in the leadership of the IACP and IACP IMPACT Section, which greatly enhances international police opportunities for all attendees hosted through ICITAP. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                On October 16, the ICITAP Courtroom Competency Training Team moderated its second “conversatorio” this year. Conversatorios are conversations between the judicial actors, including judges, prosecutors, defense and / or any other pertinent parties such as forensics experts, child advocates, etc. The goal is the creation of a space for honest dialogue to address and solve issues or problems that may arise in the administration and practice of justice in the state. This session was a first for the state of Guanajuato. Among those present were the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and Counselor of the Judicial Branch of the State of Guanajuato, and the Attorney General of the State. The Director of the ICITAP CCT Program welcomed the participants, which included approximately 63 public servants, including judges, magistrates, directors and heads of specialized units of Guanajuato’s Judicial Branch and Attorney General's Office, who actively participated in the sessions and discussions. Several public servants expressed their satisfaction with the quality and relevance of the topics addressed, as well as the practical usefulness. Four main topics were addressed at this first Guanajuato session. The first discussion highlighted the importance of presenting solid evidence at the initial appearance as a basis to link the suspect to the case and the need to standardize criteria between judges and prosecutors, which guarantees impartial and effective justice. The second topic was one that will likely affect the entire Mexican system based on a recent ruling by Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the importance of an exhaustive analysis of the data to justify preventive detention, promoting a consistent application of this measure for the benefit of public safety. Next, they discussed the effectiveness of the abbreviated procedure (plea agreement) mechanism to speed up judicial processes, with the commitment of the judiciary and the prosecutor's office to promote its use under the correct circumstances. Lastly, the coordinator for the Women’s Center for Justice discussed a proposal to create a specialized court for family violence and generated consensus on its importance to improve the protection of women and children, a crucial step towards a more inclusive and equitable justice system. This first meeting in Guanajuato between justice actors for the continuous improvement of the criminal justice system reaffirmed the importance of these spaces for discussion and mutual learning.

Amendment to Exemption 3 of the FOIAFor the second time in less than two years, Congress has passed an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act. Unlike the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, which addressed a number of procedural issues impacting FOIA administration, but did not change any of the FOIA's nine exemptions, the more recent amendment to the FOIA provides for a substantive change to Exemption 3, which pertains to matters specifically exempted from release by statute.Entitled the \"OPEN FOIA Act of 2009,\" the bill, enacted as section 564 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-83, 123 Stat. 2142, 2184, was signed by the President on October 28, 2009.The amendment consists of only one section, summarized and discussed below. For the complete text of the DHS Appropriations Act which contains the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, is also available online.Prior to the enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, Exemption 3 authorized the withholding of information \"specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) require[d] that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishe[d] particular criteria for withholding or refer[red] to particular types of matters to be withheld.\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3) (2006), amended by OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524.The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 amended Exemption 3 by adding a new requirement that any statute \"enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009\" must \"specifically cite to this paragraph.\" Thus, the text of Exemption 3 now reads as follows:(b) This section does not apply to matters that are- . . .(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute- (A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and (B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.&nbsp;118 Stat. at 2184.The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 renumbered what used to be referred to as subparts (A) and (B) of Exemption 3, previously 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(B), to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A)(i) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A)(ii), respectively, but did not change the substance of those requirements. The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 then established an additional requirement that statutes enacted after the date of the enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 must specifically cite to Exemption 3 of the FOIA in order to qualify under Exemption 3.The OPEN FOIA Act was enacted on October 28, 2009, and so this amendment impacts statutes enacted after that date. In order for any statute enacted after that date to qualify as an Exemption 3 statute, it must satisfy one of the traditional requirements, i.e. it must \"require that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue\" or \"establish particular criteria for withholding or refer to particular types of matters to be withheld.\" If enacted after October 28, 2009, the statute must meet one additional requirement; it must specifically cite to Exemption 3 in order to qualify as a withholding statute.Agencies are encouraged to contact OIP, through its FOIA Counselor service, with any questions regarding the implementation of the FOIA as amended by the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009. #> 2

                                            Segregating and Marking Documents for Release in Accordance with the OPEN Government ActSection 12 of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, amended Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which contains the requirement that agencies provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information contained in documents that are responsive to FOIA requests. Since the 1996 amendments to the FOIA, agencies have been required to indicate the amount of information deleted on the released portion of the record, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. See Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-231, § 4, 110 Stat. 3048-49 (concluding sentences); see also FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 1, at 6 (\"Amendment Implementation Questions\"); FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 2, at 2 (\"FOIA Counselor: Questions &amp; Answers\"). Moreover, the FOIA provides that if technically feasible, the amount of the withheld information should be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion is made.The OPEN Government Act added one additional requirement to this provision regarding the duty to segregate documents for release. Specifically, Section 12 of the OPEN Government Act provides that when marking documents to indicate the amount of information deleted, and the location of that deletion, agencies should also indicate the exemption being asserted. This straightforward requirement codifies what has been an existing practice for many agencies and follows the approach long recommended by the Office of Information and Privacy (OIP).Amended Segregation ProvisionSection (b) of the FOIA, which contains the FOIA's nine statutory exemptions, also directs agencies to release to FOIA requesters any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information that is contained in those records. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (sentence immediately following exemptions). As amended by the OPEN Government Act, the provision now reads:Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated on the released portion of the record unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (amended language in italics).The requirement to provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the records that are responsive to FOIA requests is a fundamental tenant of the Act. Indeed, courts have long focused on this requirement. See, e.g., Department of Justice Freedom of Information Act Guide (Mar. 2007), at 113-19 (\"Reasonably Segregable\" Obligation) (collecting cases); id. at 1005-10 (\"Reasonably Segregable\" Requirements) (likewise collecting cases). Thus, it is important that agencies remain mindful of the need to reasonably segregate and release any non-exempt information whenever they are processing a FOIA request. See, e.g., Stolt-Neilsen Transp. Group Ltd. v. United States, 534 F.3d 728, 734 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (concluding that the district court has an affirmative duty to consider reasonable segregability even if the requester never raised the issue).The remaining elements of the segregation provision, including the new statutory amendment, address how documents should be marked once it is determined that they contain reasonably segregable, non-exempt information. First, the amount of information that is being withheld, and now also the exemption under which the withholding is being made, should be indicated on the released portion of the record itself. The FOIA has long contained an exception to this requirement for those instances where revealing the amount and location of the information being redacted would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. This exception now also includes the situation where revealing the exemption itself on the face of the released-in-part document would harm an interest protected by the exemption. In such rare circumstances, the agency need not mark the released portion of the document in such a way that by doing so would cause harm to an interest protected by the exemption being asserted.For example, if a portion of an otherwise releaseable document is being protected under Exemption 7(A) to prevent interference with an on-going law enforcement investigation, and if the agency determines that indicating the amount of information being deleted under that exemption, or now, that marking Exemption 7(A) on that portion of the document will, in context with the released portions of the record, interfere with the on-going investigation, then the agency need not include those markings on that particular record. Such situations will be rare, however, and any agency processing a request which raises questions as to whether the FOIA's marking provisions apply to a given document are encouraged to contact OIP.In the vast majority of cases, the exception to the marking requirement is not applicable. As a result, the three marking requirements will ordinarily apply. Those requirements direct agencies to indicate the amount of information being withheld on the released portion of the record itself. As a result of the OPEN Government Act, agencies must now also mark the document to show the exemption under which the deletion is being made. The third marking requirement provides that agencies must, if technically feasible, place that indication as to the amount of information being deleted and the exemption being asserted, at the place in the record where the deletion occurs. Thus, a FOIA requester reviewing documents released in part would be able to see directly, in the context of the released portions of the document, how much material has been withheld, the exemption used to make the withholding, and where within the document the deletion occurred.Marking Documents for ReleaseFor most records the marking requirements will be readily met by \"blacking out\" or otherwise physically marking through the protected information in the record and then inserting a notation regarding the exemption being asserted for that particular deletion. The volume of the withheld material will be apparent from the \"blacked out\" portions, as will the location within the document where the excision occurs.In light of this, it is important that agencies do not \"white out\" information when withholding it under the FOIA, as that can make it difficult for a requester to identify the amount of withheld material and its location within a document. Instead, agencies must mark documents in a way that makes it readily apparent to the requester where within a document information has been withheld. This can be accomplished by darkening, or \"blacking out\" the withheld portions of the documents, or by inserting brackets around them, or by outlining or \"boxing\" them, or any other method that ensures that a requester can easily discern where the redactions have been made. Further, each page containing redactions should be marked to show the amount of information being withheld and the exemption being asserted and, if technically feasible, those markings should be placed at the point in the record where the deletion occurs.The following examples demonstrate several possible approaches to marking documents so that the newly added requirement to specify the exemption being asserted is met. One of the clearest ways to do that is to insert a notation as to the exemption being asserted within the space that remains after the information has been excised.When a paragraph or group of paragraphs are withheld on a page, the exemption(s) used to protect the information in the paragraphs may similarly be noted within the marked-out space.Yet another approach is to use an arrow to connect a particular redaction to the annotation indicating the applicable exemption(s), or to include the exemption notation at the end of the line where the excision occurs.These examples are illustrative and are not intended to be exclusive. Agencies will likely employ a variety of techniques to mark documents depending on the nature of the documents at issue and the redaction capabilities of the agency. The key requirement for agencies when marking documents that will be released in part is to comply with the overall purpose of the segregation provision which is to readily reveal to a requester the amount of information being withheld in a document, its location within that document, and the exemption being asserted for that redaction.ConclusionAgencies have long been required to segregate documents for release and to mark those documents to indicate the amount of information deleted and, ordinarily, the location of the deletion. The new statutory provisions of the OPEN Government Act simply add the next logical step to that requirement, mandating that the exemption being asserted in connection with a given deletion be indicated directly at the place of the deletion. The purpose of the amendment is to make it plain on the face of any record disclosed in part the agency's statutory basis for each discrete withholding contained within the document. #> 3

Annual FOIA ReportsFor the Fiscal Year 2011 Annual FOIA Reports, OIP will once again be providing agencies with an Excel tool to be used in creating their report.&nbsp; This tool, which is very similar to the one that OIP distributed last year, has many features to assist agencies in compiling their data, including built-in math checks.&nbsp; The tool will also generate the Annual FOIA Report in an open format, which is required by the Open Government Directive and is used to upload data onto FOIA.Gov.&nbsp; OIP anticipates sending agencies a link which will allow agencies to download the updated tool prior to the refresher training on Annual FOIA Reports that will be held this Fall.&nbsp; Agencies should also publish their 2011 Annual FOIA Report in the PDF or similar human-readable format traditionally used for publishing Annual FOIA Reports. #> 4

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Using Metadata in FOIA Documents Posted Online to Lay the Foundationfor Building a Government-Wide FOIA Library On April 9, 2012, the Department of Justice released version 2.0 of its Open Government Plan which detailed the Department’s “ongoing and anticipated efforts to increase openness” and which announced new Department initiatives concerning the administration of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&nbsp; A key FOIA initiative in the Department’s Open Government Plan is the development of metadata standards “that will facilitate the ability of interested persons to search for and retrieve documents across websites and disparate record keeping systems.”&nbsp;Put simply, metadata is “data about data.” &nbsp;&nbsp;Metadata provides a description and important facts about material that is posted online and is itself machine-readable and can be searched by other computers.&nbsp; When related documents, such as FOIA documents that are proactively disclosed in agency FOIA Libraries, are posted with uniform metadata it is far easier to locate them during a search of the Internet.&nbsp; Because of the value that metadata adds to search capabilities, the Department’s Office of Information Policy (OIP) is introducing a uniform metadata “FOIA tag” for agencies to use when they post FOIA processed data and documents online in agency FOIA Libraries.Through the consistent use of this standardized “FOIA tag” in posting records in their own FOIA Libraries as outlined below agencies will in effect create a “virtual” government-wide FOIA Library by allowing the public to run simple, topical keyword searches that will efficiently retrieve documents from across the universe of Federal government FOIA Libraries.&nbsp; Such searches will be able to be conducted naturally through commercial search engines that are already used by millions of people every day, by combining any topical keyword with the term “FOIA.”&nbsp; OIP will be issuing further guidance to agencies on this topic in the months ahead and plans to customize features on FOIA.gov so that users have the option to access all FOIA-tagged documents across the federal government from one single location.&nbsp;Evolution of Proactive Disclosures under the FOIASubsection (a)(2) of the FOIA requires agencies to “make available for public inspection and copying” four categories of records.&nbsp; 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2) (2006 &amp; Supp. IV. 2010).&nbsp; The first three categories, which collectively can be referred to as “operational” records, consist of final opinions made in the adjudication of cases, policy statements, and administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.&nbsp; Id. § 552(a)(2)(A-C).&nbsp; The fourth category, which is referred to as “FOIA-processed” records, consists of records requested under the FOIA which “have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Id. § 552(a)(2)(D).&nbsp;&nbsp; When agencies make these records available it is known as making a “proactive disclosure.”&nbsp; The Department’s Guide to the Freedom of Information Act provides detailed information about the FOIA’s proactive disclosure requirements.&nbsp;In addition to the proactive disclosures that are required by the FOIA statute, the President has directed agencies to “take affirmative steps to make information public,” without “wait[ing] for specific requests from the public,” and the Attorney General, in his FOIA Guidelines, has directed agencies to “readily and systematically post information online in advance of any public request.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, in compliance with these directives, agencies are engaged in an ongoing process of identifying information of interest to the public that can be made available online without the need to make a FOIA request.&nbsp;Historically, agencies made proactive disclosures by placing hard copies of the records in dedicated places in their buildings, known as “Reading Rooms.”&nbsp; With the passage of the e-FOIA Amendments of 1996, agencies were required to use “computer telecommunications” or “other electronic means” to make proactive disclosures of records created after November 1, 1996. &nbsp;As a result, while some agencies still maintained physical Reading Rooms, over time, agencies established “electronic Reading Rooms” which were dedicated pages on agency FOIA websites where proactive disclosures were posted.&nbsp; More recently, even electronic Reading Rooms are being re-imagined as agencies make documents available online in a more organic fashion, posting them throughout their overall agency websites in locations where users are more likely to look for them.&nbsp;In March 2010, OIP introduced the concept of the online “FOIA Library,” providing a centralized location for agency FOIA disclosures while allowing greater flexibility for agencies to post records wherever, and in whatever format, best meets their own needs and the needs of the community of individuals who access their websites.&nbsp; While proactively disclosed documents generally may be posted throughout agency websites, at a minimum, agencies should include FOIA-processed documents (such as “frequently requested” records and any other records that have been disclosed pursuant to a FOIA request that an agency chooses to post online) in their designated FOIA Libraries.&nbsp; Additional information on the requirements for the electronic availability of proactive disclosures is available in the Department’s Guide to the Freedom of Information Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;Agency websites are now the primary mechanism for making proactive disclosures under the FOIA, including both required disclosures pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of the FOIA and additional information that is posted online as a matter of agency discretion.&nbsp; Agencies have overwhelmingly embraced proactive disclosures as a way to provide the public with information about their activities.&nbsp; The details of those efforts are included each year in agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports and are frequently highlighted in agencies’ Success Stories.&nbsp;Yet, as the volume of material posted to websites increases, the importance of establishing uniform methods to locate it increases as well.&nbsp; Because proactively disclosed FOIA records are posted on websites maintained by 100 federal departments and agencies, and given that information on a given topic often is separately maintained by multiple agencies, it is essential that the public can quickly retrieve records of interest that are posted across these government websites.&nbsp; Technology has allowed agencies to move beyond the days when records had to be physically stored together and organized with paper indices that needed to be reviewed in order to locate material of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp; Today the public is accustomed to using commercial search engines to find information online simply by entering key words.&nbsp; Agencies can ensure that such web searches effectively locate proactive disclosures by consistently utilizing uniform metadata when posting records online, while at the same time, retaining their ability to post their records on their individual agency websites in an organic manner that serves the needs of the frequent visitors to their sites.&nbsp;Enhanced Search Capabilities through the use of MetadataBoth the President and the Attorney General have emphasized the importance of proactive disclosures and greater use of technology in creating a more open government.&nbsp; President Obama has called on agencies to use modern technology and “innovative steps” to make government more collaborative, participatory, and transparent.&nbsp; In order to achieve improved transparency, agencies must make information accessible and usable, not just available.&nbsp;Agencies not only are posting more information online than ever before, they are harnessing the power of social media, creating specially designed topical websites, and providing open format data sets to put a wealth of information into the hands of the public in a variety of different formats.&nbsp; In the FOIA context, agencies frequently still collect documents that are maintained in hard copy paper format.&nbsp; Such paper documents are typically then scanned (e.g. into PDF format) in order to be digitized for posting online.&nbsp; However, the scanning process itself does not create reliable metadata -- for example, the date that a particular document is scanned may automatically “attach” to the document instead of the date that the document was actually created.&nbsp; This can inhibit the locating of particular documents when searched for by the public.&nbsp;Federal agencies should already have processes in place for the inclusion of metadata when posting documents online.&nbsp; Agency FOIA professionals are encouraged to work with their IT staff on the inclusion of metadata in FOIA proactive disclosures.&nbsp; In doing so, agencies should be cognizant of what keywords the public are likely to use in searching for documents online.&nbsp; Relevant fields may include date, document type, subject, author/recipient name, and publishing office, as well as a variety of keywords that would help the public locate pertinent documents.&nbsp; While the content of these fields will vary by document, by adding accurate and relevant metadata based on a document’s content, agencies will increase the likelihood that a document is returned in keyword searches by members of the public.&nbsp; Through this initial guidance and as described below, OIP is now advising agencies to include in their standard metadata a “FOIA tag” so that documents posted in an agency’s FOIA Library are specifically designated as FOIA-related in the metadata associated with the document.&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional information on the incorporation of metadata into posted documents is available on the General Services Administration’s website HowTo.gov.&nbsp;Currently, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is leading an initiative to address larger issues related to the overall management of government information.&nbsp;&nbsp; OIP has collaborated with OMB and OIP’s Guidance applies specifically to the use of metadata in documents posted in agency FOIA Libraries.&nbsp; As further OMB guidance is issued in this area and as agencies and the public gain more experience in utilizing metadata, OIP will provide additional guidance on the implementation and inclusion of metadata standards in FOIA documents posted online.&nbsp; OIP will welcome feedback on the use of FOIA metadata so that we can make further improvements across the government to facilitate the ability of the public to locate FOIA-related material online.&nbsp; &nbsp;Uniform “FOIA Tag” for Documents Posted in FOIA LibrariesWith the proliferation of information and documents posted across hundreds of government websites, and the growth of material included in FOIA Libraries in particular, there is a growing interest in creating a centralized and efficient way for the public to view all FOIA-related &nbsp;documents on a given topic all at once -- i.e. having &nbsp;access to a government-wide FOIA Library.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a way to do just that.&nbsp; Collectively, all agencies can create a “virtual” government-wide FOIA Library simply by adding “FOIA” as a metadata tag to all documents posted online in their individual FOIA Libraries.&nbsp; This will allow members of the public to pair individualized search terms on the topic they are interested in, such as “Mars rover” or “world population,” with the term “FOIA” and conduct a search of the Internet using a regular search engine in order to identify records that have been tagged with these terms.&nbsp; Additionally, OIP plans to update features on FOIA.gov to enable the public to readily locate all agency documents that contain the FOIA tag, allowing the public to quickly and efficiently identify records on specific topics of interest to them that are located in FOIA Libraries.The addition of this tag should fit within existing procedures for the inclusion of metadata within documents posted by agency web managers.&nbsp; For example, the Appointment Affidavit of Attorney General Holder is a frequently requested Department of Justice record which is posted in PDF format in OIP’s FOIA Library.&nbsp; For this document, relevant metadata fields have been “tagged,” including the new “FOIA” tag, as follows:Document Title:&nbsp; Appointment Affidavit for Attorney General Eric HolderAuthor:&nbsp; Eric HolderAuthor Title:&nbsp; Attorney General of the United StatesKeywords: &nbsp;Holder, OPM-61, Standard Form 61, SF-61, Holder Appointment Affidavit, Appointment, Affidavit, Oath of Office, Oath, 2009, 2/3/2009, FOIAIn the coming months OIP will issue further guidance providing specific instructions for agencies to follow on the inclusion of the “FOIA” tag in the metadata for documents posted online in their FOIA Libraries.&nbsp; That guidance will establish the time frame for implementation of the new tagging system.&nbsp; To prepare, agency personnel should familiarize themselves with this guidance, as well as any other metadata standards required by their individual agencies.&nbsp; Additionally, FOIA personnel should begin identifying documents of significant public interest that are already available in their FOIA Libraries and which would benefit from the addition of the “FOIA” tag.ConclusionThe way that federal agencies make records available to the public, and the way that the public accesses these records, continues to evolve in the Internet era.&nbsp; As the volume of posted material increases, it is vital that the public have a fast and efficient way to locate particular documents that are of interest to them.&nbsp; Our goal is to build off of existing agency procedures and standards for the posting of documents online in order to optimize the public’s ability to locate material of interest while leveraging common search tools that utilize plain language and are familiar to the public.&nbsp; The consistent addition of a FOIA metadata tag to documents posted in agency FOIA Libraries will enable the public to more efficiently locate and retrieve government records that have been made available online pursuant to the FOIA’s proactive disclosure provision.&nbsp; The above guidance lays the groundwork and the foundation for future guidance from OIP and OMB which -- in conjunction with updates to features on FOIA.gov -- will create the first-ever virtual government-wide FOIA Library.&nbsp; #> 5 Statutes Found to Qualify under Exemption 3 of the FOIAExemption 3 of the Freedom of Information Act incorporates certain nondisclosure provisions contained in federal statutes other than the FOIA.  To assist agencies in properly processing FOIA requests and in preparing their Annual FOIA Reports, the Office of Information Policy has compiled a list of statutes that courts have found to qualify as Exemption 3 statutes.  This chart does not include statutes which have been found not to qualify under Exemption 3, nor does it include any statute which has not yet been considered by a court as a possible Exemption 3 statute.  In addition, on occasion a statute has been found to qualify under Exemption 3 by one court and found not to qualify by another.  Those statutes are marked with asterisks.

                                                                                                                                                         Implementing FOIA's Statutory Exclusion Provisions BackgroundOver twenty-five years ago, in 1986, Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to provide special protection for three categories of particularly sensitive law enforcement records. For these three specifically defined categories of records, Congress provided that federal law enforcement agencies \"may treat the records as not subject to the requirements of [the FOIA].\" 5 U.S.C. § 552(c). These provisions, which are referred to as \"exclusions\" provide protection in three limited sets of circumstances where publicly acknowledging even the existence of the records could cause harm to law enforcement or national security interests.The Three ExclusionsThe first exclusion protects against disclosure of a pending criminal law enforcement investigation where there is reason to believe that the target is unaware of the investigation and disclosure of its existence could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The second exclusion, which applies only to records maintained by criminal law enforcement agencies, protects against disclosure of unacknowledged, confidential informants. The third exclusion, which applies only to the FBI, protects against disclosure of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism records, when the existence of those records is classified.The exclusions address three especially sensitive situations arising in the criminal law enforcement or national security context where invoking an exemption will not afford adequate protection because the very act of citing the exemption confirms the existence of the protected records. At the same time, using a \"Glomar\" response, i.e., a response where the agency neither confirms nor denies the existence of the records, is not viable or practicable because it would need to be applied to a broad range of requests in order to be effective, which would greatly limit the FOIA's access provisions. Indeed, when Congress amended the FOIA to include exclusions, the \"neither confirm nor deny\" response was already in existence and used by agencies for certain categories of requests. As is explained in the guidance issued by former Attorney General Meese addressing the 1986 amendments to the FOIA, it was because the Glomar response \"inadequately protects against the particular harms in question that the more delicate exclusion mechanism, which affords a higher level of protection, sometimes must be employed.\" The exclusions themselves describe the three narrow categories of records where a \"neither confirm nor deny\" response would not be adequate.For example, when a criminal law enforcement investigation is ongoing, and the target is unaware that it is pending, but suspects that he is under investigation, he might make a FOIA request for records on himself to see if he could find out whether he was being investigated. If the agency were to respond by advising the requester that it did, in fact, have records responsive to his request, but they were being withheld under Exemption 7(A), which protects records when disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the assertion of the exemption by the agency would reveal to the requester the very thing the agency needed to protect, i.e., the existence of the ongoing investigation.If the agency were to respond by saying it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of records, i.e., provide a Glomar response, it would have to answer that way for all requests where someone asked for records on themselves, because a Glomar response is not effective unless it is used for all similar requests. That, in turn, would mean that the vast majority of requesters seeking records on themselves would receive Glomar responses, even though the chance that any particular requester was the target of an investigation covered by an exclusion would be extremely low.To avoid both of these scenarios, exclusions authorize the agency to \"treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the [FOIA].\" This permits an agency to respond to a request seeking excluded records without revealing their existence, while also allowing the agency to respond to the vast majority of requests in the traditional manner, i.e., by advising the requester whether records exist, and if they do, by releasing any information that is not exempt and asserting exemptions for any material properly protected from disclosure.In another example, if a criminal enterprise suspected it was infiltrated by an informant, it could try to uncover the suspected informant by using the FOIA. The enterprise could require the suspected informant to provide a privacy waiver and then could make a FOIA request to a law enforcement agency such as the FBI seeking any records on that individual. The submission of the privacy waiver would preclude the criminal law enforcement agency from using a privacy-based Glomar response. Without the exclusion, the law enforcement agency which was working with that informant in the criminal enterprise would be in an untenable position. Invoking Exemption 7(D), which protects confidential informants, would tip off the criminal enterprise that indeed it had been infiltrated. To address just such a scenario, the second exclusion removes criminal law enforcement informant records from the requirements of the FOIA, when they are requested by a third party, thereby providing protection for the confidential informant.For all three exclusions, the records are removed from the requirements of the FOIA only during the time that the specific requirements of each exclusion are met. Thus, once the target of a criminal law enforcement investigation becomes aware of the existence of the ongoing investigation, the first exclusion would no longer apply. Similarly, once a confidential informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed the second exclusion would no longer apply. Finally, when the existence of FBI foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or international terrorism records is no longer classified, the third exclusion would not apply.Handling of Excluded Records Under the Meese GuidelinesSince 1987, agencies have handled records excluded under these provisions according to the publicly available guidelines issued by Attorney General Meese. The Meese Guidance provided, among other things, that where the only records responsive to a request were excluded from FOIA by statute, \"a requester can properly be advised in such a situation that 'there exist no records responsive to your FOIA request.'\" The Meese Guidance also stated that it was \"essential that all agencies that could potentially employ at least one of the three exclusions ensure that their FOIA communications are consistently phrased accordingly.\" Otherwise the protection afforded by the exclusion could be \"undermined, even indirectly, by the form or substance of an agency's actions.\" These practices laid out in Attorney General Meese's Guidance have governed agency practice for more than twenty-five years.Increased Transparency and Accountability Regarding ExclusionsThe Department has examined those past practices governing use of exclusions to determine whether there are ways to bring greater accountability and transparency to the existence and use of exclusions in the FOIA without compromising the important national security and law enforcement interests that are at stake. As a result of that review, the Department has determined that there are a series of steps that agencies should take going forward that will achieve these goals.Consultation with Office of Information PolicyAs a threshold matter, given the unusual nature of the exclusion provisions, the limited circumstances in which they apply, and the relative infrequency with which they are employed, any agency considering whether to invoke an exclusion should consult first with the Office of Information Policy. This will help ensure that all aspects of the request and possible excludable records are reviewed and analyzed before determining whether use of an exclusion is warranted.&nbsp;Public Reporting on Exclusion UseIn order to have a greater understanding of the government's use of exclusions, it is important for the public to know how often exclusions are invoked and by which agencies. To accomplish that, the Department has established a new reporting requirement that directs agencies to publicly report each year on the number of times, if any, that they invoked an exclusion. This reporting will be required yearly, as part of each agency's Chief FOIA Officer Report.This new reporting requirement began with the 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports and immediately revealed the limited number of times exclusions had been invoked. Only three agencies out of the ninety-nine subject to the FOIA in Fiscal Year 2011 reported having invoked an exclusion during the preceding fiscal year. Those agencies were the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and EPA, which has some criminal law enforcement responsibilities.Specifically, the Department of Justice reported using exclusions in 147 requests out of the 63,992 requests that were processed in Fiscal Year 2011. The Department of Homeland Security reported using exclusions in less than twenty-eight requests out of the 145,631 requests processed in Fiscal Year 2011, and EPA reported using an exclusion three times out of the 10,435 requests it processed during that fiscal year. In total, out of 631,424 requests processed across the government in Fiscal Year 2011, exclusions were invoked in less than 178 cases, which is 0.03% of all processed requests. Because of this new public reporting requirement, interested members of the public can now readily see the extremely limited number of cases in which exclusions are invoked.&nbsp;Description of Exclusions on Agency FOIA WebsitesIn addition to public reporting, each agency can bring greater transparency to the topic of exclusions by ensuring that their FOIA website contains a brief description of the three statutory exclusions. In that way, when a member of the public is reviewing an agency's FOIA website in anticipation of making a FOIA request, he or she will be made aware of the fact that in addition to the nine exemptions to the FOIA there are also three narrow categories of records that can be excluded. An agency's FOIA Reference Guide is a logical place to include such a description.&nbsp;Individual Notification in Response Letters Because exclusions are limited to criminal law enforcement records or to certain national security records of the FBI, most agencies will never have occasion to invoke an exclusion. That fact is evident from the public reporting that the Department of Justice now requires and which showed that in Fiscal Year 2011 only three agencies used an exclusion.While their use is quite limited, the Department is hereby changing its previous guidance concerning how law enforcement components where excluded records might exist should word their responses to FOIA requests. Going forward, when a component that maintains criminal law enforcement records responds to a request, it should notify the requester that the FOIA excludes certain records from the requirements of the FOIA and that the agency’s response addresses only those records that are subject to the FOIA. To ensure that these notifications do not themselves reveal the existence of excluded records in a particular case, those components of agencies that maintain criminal law enforcement records and might possibly use an exclusion should include the notification in response to all their requests.For example, the FBI and Federal Bureau of Prisons within the Department of Justice, as well as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which are all agency components that maintain criminal law enforcement records, should include the notification in all their response letters. Beyond DHS and the Department of Justice, there are other agencies with components that maintain criminal law enforcement records, such as EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, or any agency's Office of Inspector General. These agency components should likewise be including a notification about exclusions in response to all their requests.Including such a notification represents a fresh approach to the handling of exclusions. This approach both informs requesters of the existence of the statutory exclusions in general, but does not acknowledge the existence of any excluded records in response to any specific request. This new approach will thus preserve the important law enforcement and national security interests that formed the basis for Congress’ inclusion of exclusions in the FOIA over twenty-five years ago, while at the same time be in keeping with Attorney General Holder’s commitment to open government.4(a). Content of New Language Addressing Exclusions for Response LettersBecause exclusions are limited to criminal law enforcement records or certain national security-related records maintained by the FBI, the FBI and all agency components that maintain criminal law enforcement records should include the following language in response to all their requests:“For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.”This language should be a standard notification that is included in the FOIA responses of the FBI and other agency components that maintain criminal law enforcement records.4(b). Impact of Notification Significantly, in the limited circumstances where an exclusion is actually invoked, this new notification requirement will ensure that the agency is providing to the requester in its response letter three important facts. The letter with the notification will:advise the requester of the existence of the three statutory exclusions,inform the requester that excluded records are not subject to the requirements of the FOIA, andput the requester on notice that any excluded records are not part of the response being provided by the agency.With the excluded records addressed by virtue of this notification, the criminal law enforcement component can then respond to the remainder of the request in the usual way, advising the requester of the handling of any records that exist that are subject to the FOIA. This new, more transparent approach will provide requesters with a clear explanation of the agency’s actions and the reasoning behind the handling of requests.ConclusionThis guidance is intended to provide greater transparency and accountability to a distinct aspect of the FOIA, which while used in a very limited number of cases, is expressly part of the FOIA statute and is necessary to protect vital law enforcement and national security interests. Using this multi-layered approach to implementing the FOIA's statutory exclusion provisions will ensure that the public is better informed about the existence of records that are \"excluded\" or outside the requirements of the FOIA.The new reporting requirement contained in Chief FOIA Officer Reports will allow the public to readily see the extent to which exclusions are employed each year and by which agencies. The description of exclusions on agency websites will further increase public understanding of this distinct part of the law. Lastly, this new approach ensures that requesters to law enforcement components where excluded records might exist are advised that there are records outside the requirements of the FOIA and that such records are not part of the agency's response. At the same time, because the notification will be included in any response made by a criminal law enforcement component, its inclusion will not reveal in any specific case whether excluded records were located or not. In its totality this new approach will ensure greater transparency and accountability in the handling of statutory exclusions.&nbsp; #>   changed created date teaser #> 1    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 2    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 3    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 4    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 5    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 6    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #>                                                                                                              title #> 1                                                             Congress Passes Amendment to Exemption 3 of the FOIA #> 2                         Segregating and Marking Documents for Release in Accordance With the Open Government Act #> 3                                                          Open Format Requirements for Agency Annual FOIA Reports #> 4 Using Metadata in FOIA Documents Posted Online to Lay the Foundation for Building a Government-Wide FOIA Library #> 5                                        FOIA Post (2009): Statutes Found to Qualify under Exemption 3 of the FOIA #> 6                                                          Implementing FOIA&#039;s Statutory Exclusion Provisions #>                                                                                                                         url #> 1                                https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2010-congress-passes-amendment-exemption-3-foia #> 2    https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2008-oip-guidance-segregating-and-marking-documents-release-accordance-open #> 3                                      https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/open-format-requirements-agency-annual-foia-reports #> 4 https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/using-metadata-foia-documents-posted-online-lay-foundation-building-government-wide-foia #> 5                    https://www.justice.gov/archives/oip/blog/foia-post-2009-statutes-found-qualify-under-exemption-3-foia #> 6                                        https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/implementing-foias-statutory-exclusion-provisions #>                                   uuid name #> 1 2aa54c90-c455-4f78-8bea-b6739f0d94cb <NA> #> 2 38747d07-f489-4036-aba3-08559f4521d5 <NA> #> 3 0fd603ac-951f-460d-912f-38d29085e4ce <NA> #> 4 cb839243-a286-439c-a81e-3213f28e3de8 <NA> #> 5 823ade26-0f7e-407b-90e1-62cdf4f19ddf <NA> #> 6 fcaaccfb-c75f-4cd0-b70b-ac4e01ea63e3 <NA>"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"accessing U.S. Department Justice (DOJ) open data press releases.","code":""},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"","code":"doj_press_releases(     n_results = 50,     search_direction = \"DESC\",     keyword = NULL,     clean = TRUE   )"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"n_results number results return. default, 50 results returned. search_direction Set ASC DESC fetch data starting least recent entries. default, data sorted descending order (recent entries). keyword return results containing keyword.

Kirkpatrick. He also was ordered to pay restitution to his victims and a $7,500 assessment pursuant to the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Assistance Act of 2018.&nbsp;“Few crimes are as heinous as the sexual exploitation of minors,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kirkpatrick. “My office will continue to prioritize charging predators who hold positions of trust in our community. &nbsp;Coaches, daycare providers, and others in positions of trust who prey on children will face federal justice.” &nbsp;“The sentencing of Lucas Mathew Kramer concludes a successful investigation focused on those who seek to exploit our children. HSI will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who target our young people,” said ICE HSI Saint Paul Special Agent in Charge Jamie Holt. “We appreciate the collaboration with our law enforcement partners and stand by our commitment to protecting our communities and securing our homeland.”According to court documents, on September 23, 2022, law enforcement received a tip that an online individual with the username “northernboy35” had used the Kik messenger application to upload 19 videos of child pornography to the internet. Less than a week later, the same username uploaded five additional child pornography videos to the internet. Law enforcement quickly determined that the uploaded files originated from Duluth, Minnesota, and linked the email and IP address for the “nothernboy35” moniker directly to Lucas Mathew Kramer, 45, a longtime collegiate climbing coach.&nbsp;Law enforcement proceeded to execute a search warrant at Kramer’s residence and discovered that he had knowingly possessed over 600 images and videos of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on numerous electronic devices. His CSAM collection included the graphic sexual abuse of prepubescent children—some as young as toddlers—and included videos depicting children being physically forced into sexual compliance. Kramer admitted that he downloaded and traded his CSAM collection with others on the internet. Law enforcement also discovered evidence of sexually explicit chats between Kramer and self-identified prepubescent minors, where he engaged the self-identified minors in sexually explicit conversations and encouraged them to take and send nude images of themselves. &nbsp; &nbsp;Kramer pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography on October 11, 2024. He was sentenced in U.S. District Court by Judge Eric C. Tostrud on March 19, 2024.

Ramsdell announced today that&nbsp;U.S. District Judge Camela C. Theeler has sentenced an Oglala, South Dakota, man following his conviction for two counts of Receipt of Child Pornography.&nbsp;The sentencing took place on March 17, 2025.Johnathan Morrison, 34, was sentenced to eight years and nine months in federal prison on each count for a total of 210 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release on each count with the time to run concurrently, and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment to the Federal Crime Victims Fund for each count. Morrison was also ordered to pay $95 in restitution to the South Dakota Internet Crimes Investigation Fund and to forfeit his interest in a smartphone. He will also be required to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.A federal grand jury indicted Morrison in February of 2024. He pleaded guilty on January 8, 2025.In August 2023, Morrison solicited a 10-year old female to engage in sexually explicit conduct over social media. Shortly thereafter, an adult learned that Morrison had enticed the child and reported Morrison’s criminal actions to the Oglala Sioux Tribe Department of Public Safety. Morrison was immediately apprehended and arrested. His smartphone was seized as evidence. An extraction of his smartphone revealed that prior to August 2023, Morrison downloaded and installed multiple social media platforms, including KIK, Telegram, and Snapchat onto his cellular device. Through these platforms, Morrison solicited, sent, and received images and videos containing child pornography. Some of the images recovered involved prepubescent females engaged in sexual acts. Through his chats, investigators learned that Morrison had an interest in 10-14 year old females. The search also revealed that Morrison had made sexual advances to his girlfriend’s teenage daughter and that he had covertly photographed her over 130 times with his smartphone.This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.

She was also ordered to pay over&nbsp;$20 million in restitution to the IRS.Beatriz Toledo, 61, owned&nbsp;Immigration and Tax Service Group LLC. For tax years 2017 through 2021, Toledo,&nbsp;through her company, willfully prepared false and fraudulent tax returns for clients, which included false claims for the Residential Energy Credit (allowing taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified energy-saving expenses), false itemized deductions for state and local sales taxes, and false business expenses. Through these false claims, Toledo’s clients’ taxable income decreased, leading to bigger tax refunds.During the scheme, Toledo submitted about 7,800 tax returns with fraudulent claims for residential energy tax credits, resulting in her clients’ underpayment of about $20 million in federal taxes. Toledo’s company received approximately $7.1 million in tax preparation fees that it took directly out of clients’ refund checks.Toledo engaged in this criminal conduct in violation of a permanent injunction previously entered against her by a federal district judge in 2010. Case No. 09-cv-21987-COOKE. In that civil case, the United States sued to bar Toledo from preparing false tax returns. Toledo agreed to a permanent injunction, which the district court entered on July 26, 2020. The injunction prohibited her from engaging in the conduct described above. Despite the injunction’s prohibitions, Toledo continued to prepare false tax returns and was indicted in 2024.&nbsp;U.S. Attorney Hayden P.

one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced today.            Juan A. \"Tony\" Marrero, 41, Belkis Marrero, 41, and Luz Borrego, 43, each pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2009, to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in the Southern District of Florida. In their pleas, Tony and Belkis Marrero admitted that they co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;P).      Medcore and M&amp;P purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. The Marreros admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 they conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Borrego acknowledged her role in the fraud at Medcore where she was a phlebotomist who administered unnecessary drugs intravenously to HIV patients. Tony Marrero also pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracies to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud. Sentencing for all three defendants is scheduled for April 3, 2009.      During their pleas, the defendants admitted that Medcore and M&amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare and that the treatments for infused or injected drugs billed to Medicare were not medically necessary. Each of the defendants also admitted that all of the patients at the clinics were participants in the fraud. The defendants admitted that they, or their co-conspirators, entered into kickback arrangements with these Medicare beneficiaries whereby the beneficiaries were paid every week in exchange for their Medicare billing information, which allowed the clinics to submit the fraudulent bills.      To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Tony Marrero admitted that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.      The defendants admitted that none of the Medicare beneficiaries needed the injection and infusion treatments billed to Medicare by the clinics. Tony and Belkis Marrero acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Belkis Marrero and Borrego also admitted that they put together medical files to make them appear legitimate and that they supported the treatments being billed to Medicare.      On Jan. 7, 2009, Orlando Pascual Jr., a co-owner of Medcore and M&amp;P, pleaded guilty to his role in the Medicare fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a separate durable medical equipment company that he operated from 2001 to 2003.      On Jan. 14, 2009, Harold Sio, the owner of pharmaceutical wholesale company named Lifecare Medical, was charged by criminal information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sio, whose company supplied Medcore and M&amp;P with infusible drugs, allegedly conspired with Pascual and Tony Marrero to accomplish the health care fraud scheme by providing false invoices for the drugs allegedly used in the scheme.      Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 9, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment and an information are merely charges, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.      The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S. (Jay) Darden, and Trial Attorney Charles Reed of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General and the FBI. The case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (MFSF), supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and U.S. Attorney Acosta of the Southern District of Florida. Since the inception of MFSF operations, federal prosecutors have indicted 106 cases with 190 defendants in both Los Angeles and Miami. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for more than half a billion dollars. #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        WASHINGTON - A federal court has ordered CPA Steven W. McCann, who operates a firm called SWMc Services in the Houma, La., area, to stop claiming improper tax deductions on federal income tax returns he prepares for customers, the Justice Department announced today. McCann agreed to the civil injunction order.      According to the         government complaint filed in the case, McCann prepared nearly 1,000 federal income tax returns claiming fraudulent employee expense deductions for customers who work as mariners. The government alleged that these deductions were false because the expenses McCann claimed for his customers were never paid by the clients. Instead, their employers provided the items being deducted, including meals and other incidental expenses. In 2007, a         federal court in Los Angeles barred another CPA, Martin A. Kapp, from promoting a similar scheme.      \"The IRS and Justice Department are committed to stopping tax preparers who continue to promote the mariner’s tax deduction, which courts have held is frivolous,\" said Nathan J. Hochman, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Tax Division. \"The Justice Department has obtained injunctions against more than 365 tax return preparers and tax-fraud promoters since 2001.\" Information about those cases is available         on the Justice Department Web site.      Assistant Attorney General Hochman thanked trial attorney Grayson Hoffman and IRS revenue agent Phil Rampey for their efforts in obtaining this injunction for the government. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON – Zubair Ahmed, 29, and Khaleel Ahmed, 28, both residents of Chicago, pleaded guilty today in the Northern District of Ohio to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists in connection with their efforts to travel abroad in order to murder or maim U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.      Today’s guilty pleas were announced by Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security; William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio; and C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).      Zubair Ahmed and his cousin Khaleel Ahmed each pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge James G. Carr in Toledo, Ohio, to a one-count, superseding information charging them with conspiracy to provide material support and resources, including the defendants themselves as personnel, to terrorists in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. Section 2339A. At sentencing, each defendant faces a statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, followed by three years of supervised release.      According to the superseding information and other information entered into the court record today:      The criminal conspiracy involving Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed began no later than April 1, 2004, and continued until their arrests on Feb. 21, 2007. As part of the conspiracy, the defendants made preparations to travel overseas in order to engage in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in either Iraq or Afghanistan. On or about May 21, 2004, the defendants traveled to Cairo, Egypt, with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.      After their return from Egypt, on or about July 4, 2004, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed discussed, sought and received instruction on firearms from another individual in Cleveland. The defendants also sought and discussed training in counter-surveillance techniques and sniper rifles with this individual. Specifically, defendant Zubair Ahmed discussed his desire to learn how to use and move with a .50-caliber machine gun.      As part of the conspiracy, the defendants also communicated with each other using code words and in a foreign language to disguise their preparations and plans to engage in acts abroad that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.      Furthermore, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed researched the purchase of firearms, methods of obtaining firearms instruction (including at least one visit to a firing range) and methods of obtaining instruction in gunsmithing. In addition, the defendants collected and distributed videos of attacks on U.S. military forces overseas, manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry.      \"Today’s guilty pleas should send a strong message to individuals who would use this country as a platform to plot attacks against U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \"This case also underscores the need for continued vigilance in identifying and dismantling extremist plots that develop within our nation.\"      William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said: \"These guilty pleas are testament to the hard work and dedication of all the federal, state and local law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating this case and to the tireless efforts and perseverance of an extremely talented team of federal prosecutors who, with their law enforcement partners, keep this country safe from terrorists.\"      C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division, FBI, said: \"This case is an example of our continued efforts to detect terrorist planning and to prevent acts of terrorism before they occur.&nbsp; Through close cooperation with our law enforcement partners in Illinois and Ohio, this case resulted in the successful prosecution of these individuals.\"      This case was investigated by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Chicago, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio, with the assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Chicago Police Department; the Illinois State Police; the Ohio Highway Patrol; the Toledo Police Department; and the Lucas and Wood County Sheriff’s Departments.&nbsp;      This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E. Getz and Justin E. Herdman of the National Security Unit of the U.S Attorney’s Office in Cleveland; as well Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg N. Sofer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Austin, Texas (formerly of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section); and Trial Attorneys Jerome J. Teresinski and Jolie F. Zimmerman of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago also provided assistance in this case. #> 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON - The Justice Department today announced that it has reached a settlement with the State of Georgia regarding the conditions at Georgia’s seven psychiatric hospitals. The Department opened its investigation of Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals in 2007 and issued findings regarding Georgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta on May 30, 2008. The Department subsequently entered into negotiations regarding remedies the State was required to implement to correct unconstitutional conditions at all the hospitals. The other state facilities involved in today’s settlement include: Georgia Regional Hospital at Savannah, Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Southwestern State Hospital, East Central State Hospital, West Central State Hospital, and Northwest Georgia Regional Hospital at Rome.      \"When a state undertakes to care for persons with mental illness and developmental disabilities, it accepts responsibility to protect them from harm,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"The Department commends Governor Sonny Perdue, State Attorney General Thurbert Baker, and the Georgia Department of Human Resources for their willingness to work aggressively to address the conditions at these seven psychiatric hospitals. The leadership of the State in amicably resolving this matter has been paramount to today's exceptional result on behalf of the people of the State of Georgia. We are pleased that we have cooperatively achieved a settlement agreement that will benefit the lives of persons with mental health problems and developmental disabilities in Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals.\"      Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the State will work to ensure that patients at the seven hospitals are safe and receive the care and services necessary to meet their individualized needs. Specifically, the State has agreed to undertake a variety of measures, including improving medical and mental health care and ensuring that patients are free from undue bodily restraint. The State will also improve discharge planning and ensure that each patient is served in the most integrated setting appropriate.      Today's settlement with the State of Georgia is the result of a cooperative effort by State entities and the Justice Department to reach a settlement that will make meaningful changes to improve the care and treatment of patients at Georgia’s seven psychiatric hospitals. This Administration is firmly committed to the vigorous protection of the rights of persons with disabilities.      The Civil Rights Division is authorized to conduct investigations of public psychiatric hospitals under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). This statute allows the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses such as those discovered in Georgia. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations in other in-patient mental health facilities in the District of Columbia, Vermont, and California, among other states. The Civil Rights Division has open investigations of mental health facilities in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Oregon.      CRIPA authorizes the Attorney General to investigate conditions in certain institutions owned or operated by, or on behalf of, state or local governments. These institutions include nursing homes, residential facilities serving people with mental or other developmental disabilities, mental health facilities, jails, prisons, and juvenile justice facilities.

SouthernCare operates approximately 99 locations that provide hospice services in 15 states.      Hospices provide palliative care – any form of medical care or treatment that concentrates on reducing the severity of a disease’s symptoms – to patients who decide to forego curative care of their illness. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to hospice care if they have a terminal prognosis of six months or less to live. The government alleged that SouthernCare was submitting false claims for hospice care for patients who were not eligible for such care.      \"The Medicare hospice benefit is intended to provide compassionate end of life care to terminally ill patients,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division. \"This settlement sends a clear message that the Department of Justice will not allow health care providers to take advantage of beneficiaries in their attempts to game the reimbursement system.\"      Today’s settlement results from two qui tam suits filed by two former SouthernCare employees, Tanya Rice and Nancy Romeo, on behalf of the United States. The False Claims Act authorizes private parties to file suit against those who defraud the United States and to receive a share of any recovery. The United States will pay $4.9 million to the individuals who filed the actions against SouthernCare.      \"Our investigation showed a pattern and practice to falsely admit patients to hospice care who did not qualify and to bill Medicare for that care. This resulted in taxpayers bearing inappropriate costs. Today’s settlement evidences the Department of Justice’s efforts to both protect the public monies and safeguard Medicare beneficiaries,\" said Alice H. Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.      \"This significant settlement demonstrates our commitment to protect the Medicare trust fund from fraud and abuse and to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality care,\" said David E. Nahmias, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia,. \"Every provider that submits claims to the Medicare program must ensure that its services are billed appropriately. Falsely admitting people to hospice care who did not qualify for the benefit exposed these patients to potential harm and contributes to the soaring costs of health care for everyone.\"      As part of the settlement, SouthernCare will enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to address the allegations raised in the qui tam complaints.      \"Today’s Corporate Integrity Agreement contains rigorous provisions specifically designed to ensure SouthernCare’s future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid hospice eligibility requirements,\" said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General for HHS.&nbsp;\"This agreement demonstrates OIG’s commitment to protect the integrity of federal health care programs.\"      The investigation was jointly handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northen District of Georgia, the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI. #> 6 WASHINGTON — Executives from LG Display Co. Ltd. and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. have agreed to plead guilty and serve jail time in the United States for participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) panels, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today.      According to a one-count felony charge filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chang Suk \"C.S.\" Chung, a Korean LG executive, conspired with unnamed employees from other panel makers to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels from on or about Sept. 21, 2001, to on or about June 1, 2006. According to a separate one-count felony charge, also filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chieng-Hon \"Frank\" Lin, a Taiwanese former executive from Chunghwa, and Chih-Chun \"C.C.\" Liu and Hsueh-Lung \"Brian\" Lee, Taiwanese current employees of Chungwha, are charged with participating in the same conspiracy at various times during the period from Sept. 14, 2001, to on or about Dec. 1, 2006.      Under the plea agreements, which must be approved by the court, all four executives have agreed to serve a term of imprisonment, pay a criminal fine and assist the government in its ongoing TFT-LCD investigation.      TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. In 2006, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was approximately $70 billion.      \"These cases involve the first Taiwanese nationals to face imprisonment in the United States for an antitrust offense,\" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department of Justice is committed to holding accountable all conspirators who harm American consumers, no matter where they live or where they commit the crime.\"      During the conspiracy, Chang Suk Chung, a Korean citizen, worked as LG’s Vice President of Monitor Sales. Under the plea agreement, Chung has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $25,000 criminal fine.      During the charged conspiracy period, Chieng-Hon Lin, a Taiwanese and U.S. citizen, was Chunghwa’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Under the plea agreement, Lin has agreed to serve a nine-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $50,000 criminal fine.      Chih-Chun Liu, a Taiwanese citizen, was Chunghwa’s Vice President of LCD Sales during the charged conspiracy period. Under the plea agreement, Liu has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $30,000 criminal fine.      Hsueh-Lung Lee, a Taiwanese citizen, held various sales positions at Chunghwa during the charged conspiracy period, including Vice President of LCD Sales. Under the plea agreement, Lee has agreed to serve a six-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $20,000 criminal fine.      These four foreign-based executives were charged with participating with co-conspirators in a conspiracy that was accomplished by:    Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT-LCD panels;  Agreeing during these meetings, conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT-LCD panels at certain predetermined levels;  Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached;  Exchanging information on sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices; and  Authorizing, ordering and consenting to the participation of subordinate employees in the conspiracy.        \"These are the first individuals to plead guilty to a charge of fixing prices in this active investigation into antitrust violations in the TFT-LCD industry,\" said Scott D. Hammond, the Antitrust Division’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement. \"We will continue in our efforts to bring to justice other domestic and foreign-based executives who were involved with fixing TFT-LCD prices.\"      On Dec. 15, 2008, LG pleaded guilty to participating in this conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $400 million criminal fine – the second largest fine in Antitrust Division history. On Jan. 14, 2009, Chunghwa pleaded guilty to participating in the same conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $65 million criminal fine.      On Dec. 16, 2008, Sharp Corp. pleaded guilty to three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels sold to Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc., and was sentenced to pay a $120 million criminal fine.      The four executives are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of $1 million and up to 10 years in prison for an individual. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.      These pleas are the result of a joint investigation by the Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Field Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Francisco.      Anyone with information concerning illegal conduct in the TFT-LCD industry is urged to call the San Francisco Field Office of the Antitrust Division at 415-436-6660. #>   changed created       date number #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-042 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-045 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-041 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-048 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-043 #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-046 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         teaser #> 1                                                                                                                      The owners and operators of two Miami medical clinics, along with a phlebotomist at one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme.  #> 2                                                                                          A federal court has ordered CPA Steven W.
