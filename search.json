            From October 27 to November 7, ICITAP’s Engaging Multinational Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) program conducted a surveillance and counter surveillance training for 15 female officers in Jordan’s Public Security Directorate's (PSD) Special Branch (SB). The officers participating in the training are assigned to the SB’s Special Surveillance Unit and/or the newly established All-Female Counterterrorism Team. The training lasted three weeks in total and covered elements critical to physical surveillance operations, such as mission planning, foot and vehicle surveillance, threat recognition, among other topics. This training is the first of two iterations planned for SB in closing of 2024 activities. Via participation in this course, EMPoWER is seeking to strengthen SB’s female officer’s capacity to engage in operational assignments. EMPoWER continues to work with SB to increase the meaningful participation of women in counterterrorism law enforcement. In Jordan, ICITAP-EMPoWER is managed with the support of and in coordination with the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism. #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      From October 28, 2024, to November 1, ICITAP, with support and funding from the U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), trained 19 officials from the Colombian National Police (CNP) and the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) Technical Investigations Corps (CTI) in the planning to solve criminal cases course.

Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the \"Wordly\" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section. The IACP and IMPACT Section annual memberships allow members access to IACP policies, to network, and to gain from emailed policing information including webinars, good practices, and Quarterly IACP IMPACT Section international police Zoom meetings and presentations. Several ICITAP employees and contractors hold key positions in the leadership of the IACP and IACP IMPACT Section, which greatly enhances international police opportunities for all attendees hosted through ICITAP. #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                On October 16, the ICITAP Courtroom Competency Training Team moderated its second “conversatorio” this year. Conversatorios are conversations between the judicial actors, including judges, prosecutors, defense and / or any other pertinent parties such as forensics experts, child advocates, etc. The goal is the creation of a space for honest dialogue to address and solve issues or problems that may arise in the administration and practice of justice in the state. This session was a first for the state of Guanajuato. Among those present were the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and Counselor of the Judicial Branch of the State of Guanajuato, and the Attorney General of the State. The Director of the ICITAP CCT Program welcomed the participants, which included approximately 63 public servants, including judges, magistrates, directors and heads of specialized units of Guanajuato’s Judicial Branch and Attorney General's Office, who actively participated in the sessions and discussions. Several public servants expressed their satisfaction with the quality and relevance of the topics addressed, as well as the practical usefulness. Four main topics were addressed at this first Guanajuato session. The first discussion highlighted the importance of presenting solid evidence at the initial appearance as a basis to link the suspect to the case and the need to standardize criteria between judges and prosecutors, which guarantees impartial and effective justice. The second topic was one that will likely affect the entire Mexican system based on a recent ruling by Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the importance of an exhaustive analysis of the data to justify preventive detention, promoting a consistent application of this measure for the benefit of public safety. Next, they discussed the effectiveness of the abbreviated procedure (plea agreement) mechanism to speed up judicial processes, with the commitment of the judiciary and the prosecutor's office to promote its use under the correct circumstances. Lastly, the coordinator for the Women’s Center for Justice discussed a proposal to create a specialized court for family violence and generated consensus on its importance to improve the protection of women and children, a crucial step towards a more inclusive and equitable justice system. This first meeting in Guanajuato between justice actors for the continuous improvement of the criminal justice system reaffirmed the importance of these spaces for discussion and mutual learning. The active participation of the attendees and the constant exchange of ideas is evidence that these forums guide necessary change in the evolution of efficiency, transparency, and practice of the justice system. ICITAP is committed to continue recommending the implementation of these inter-agency discussions across Mexico. The first state to participate in this exercise was Tabasco and the next is scheduled in Baja California Sur.&nbsp; #>   changed created       date #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2024-11-07 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2024-11-01 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2024-10-30 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2024-10-30 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2024-10-22 #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2024-10-16 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     teaser #> 1                                                                                               From October 27 to November 7, ICITAP’s Engaging Multinational Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) program conducted a surveillance and counter surveillance training for 15 female officers in Jordan’s Public Security Directorate's (PSD) Special Branch (SB). #> 2 From October 28, 2024, to November 1, ICITAP, with support and funding from the U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), trained 19 officials from the Colombian National Police (CNP) and the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) Technical Investigations Corps (CTI) in the planning to solve criminal cases course. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The nomination period for the 2025&nbsp;Sunshine&nbsp;Week&nbsp;FOIA&nbsp;Awards is now open!



                                      Presidential Statement and White House Memorandum on the FOIA Issued During Sunshine WeekOn March 16, 2010, during Sunshine Week, the White House issued both a Presidential Statement and a Memorandum on the FOIA.&nbsp; First, President Obama issued a statement on the FOIA.&nbsp; In his Statement, the President applauded the work that has been done so far to increase transparency.&nbsp; He also recommitted his administration “to be the most open and transparent ever.”&nbsp; After highlighting some of the transparency initiatives the White House has undertaken, the President concluded by stating that “our work is not done” and that “[w]e will continue to work toward an unmatched level of transparency, participation, and accountability across the entire Administration.”On that same day, Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff, and Bob Bauer, Counsel to the President, issued a Memorandum to the Heads of Departments and Agencies on the Freedom of Information Act.&nbsp; The Memorandum highlights the successful work that has been done by agencies “to make the government more open and accountable to the American people.”&nbsp; The White House also expressed appreciation to agencies for their efforts in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and confidence that agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports will demonstrate the progress achieved thus far.At the same time, the White House points out that “more work remains to be done, and such work requires persistent effort.”&nbsp; The White House requests department and agency heads to take action in two specific areas “to ensure full implementation of the President's Memorandum on FOIA.”&nbsp;First, agencies are instructed to update all their FOIA guidance and training materials “to include the principles articulated in the President's Memorandum.”&nbsp; Second, the White House directs agencies to “assess whether [they] are devoting adequate resources to responding to FOIA requests promptly and cooperatively, consistent with the requirements for addressing this Presidential priority.”The Memorandum closes by noting that agencies may already be taking these and other steps as part of their drafting of their Open Government Plans, which are being developed as a result of the Open Government Directive.As these White House transmissions convey, agencies should be very proud of the work they have accomplished thus far in improving transparency.&nbsp; Although there is more work to be done in the year ahead, a preliminary review of&nbsp;agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports reveals that the key agencies across the government, which handle the bulk of the FOIA requests, have made real progress in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; Complete details about agency activities and progress will be forthcoming in OIP's report on its review and analysis of the Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&nbsp; A summary containing highlights from those reports is available on our website. #> 2 Guidelines for 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to the Department of JusticePursuant to Attorney General Holder's FOIA GuidelinesPresident Obama's FOIA Memorandum On his first full day in office, President Obama demonstrated his commitment to the ideals of transparency and openness by issuing a Memorandum to the heads of all Executive Branch departments and agencies calling on them to \"renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA.\"&nbsp; The President directed all agencies to administer the FOIA with a clear presumption in favor of disclosure, to resolve doubts in favor of openness, and to not withhold information based on \"speculative or abstract fears.\"&nbsp;In addition, the President called on agencies to ensure that requests are responded to in \"a spirit of cooperation,\" that disclosures are made timely, and that modern technology is used to make information available to the public even before a request is made.&nbsp; To carry out these responsibilities, the President directed the Attorney General to issue new guidelines governing the FOIA.&nbsp;Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines In accordance with the President's directive, on March 19, 2009, Attorney General Holder issued new FOIA guidelines which called on all agencies to reaffirm the government's \"fundamental commitment to open government.\"&nbsp; The Guidelines stress that the FOIA is to be administered with the presumption of openness called for by the President.&nbsp; The Attorney General strongly encouraged agencies to make discretionary disclosures of information.&nbsp; He also directed agencies not to withhold information simply because they may do so legally and to consider making partial disclosures when full disclosures are not possible.In his FOIA Guidelines the Attorney General also comprehensively addressed the need for each agency to ensure that it has in place an effective system for responding to requests.&nbsp; The Attorney General stressed the importance of proactive disclosures of information, use of technology, and the need to respond to requests promptly.&nbsp; Significantly, in his FOIA Guidelines the Attorney General emphasized that \"[e]ach agency must be fully accountable for its administration of the FOIA.\"Agency Accountability The Attorney General has highlighted the key role played by each agency's Chief FOIA Officer and emphasized that \"[i]mproving FOIA performance requires [their] active participation.\"&nbsp; Accordingly, the Attorney General directed agency Chief FOIA Officers to review \"all aspects of their agencies' FOIA administration\" and to report each year to the Department of Justice on the steps taken \"to improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their agencies.\"The White House, through a memorandum to agency heads sent March 16, 2010, from both the White House Chief of Staff and Counsel to the President, requested that agencies take certain actions \"to ensure full implementation of the President's Memorandum on FOIA.\" Specifically, the March 16, 2010 White House Memorandum asked agencies to ensure that their FOIA guidance and training materials were updated \"to include the principles articulated in the President's Memorandum.\" Second, agencies were asked to assess whether they were \"devoting adequate resources to responding to FOIA requests promptly and cooperatively, consistent with the requirements for addressing this Presidential priority.\" &nbsp; &nbsp;Chief FOIA Officer ReportsAgencies submitted their first Chief FOIA Officer Reports in March 2010 and reported on a wide variety of initiatives, big and small, that had been undertaken across the government to improve transparency in keeping with the President's and Attorney General's FOIA Memoranda.&nbsp; OIP prepared an extensive summary of the information contained in those reports and issued guidance to agencies on steps they could take to achieve even greater transparency in the year ahead.Content and Timing of 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports In accordance with the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines, OIP is charged with the responsibility for providing guidance to agencies on the timing and content of agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&nbsp; The guidelines for the 2011 Reports are set out below.&nbsp;&nbsp; While the overall topics to be addressed in the reports remain the same as last year, for 2011 the five key areas contain additional, more targeted elements that should be addressed.&nbsp; All agencies should follow these guidelines in preparing and submitting their 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports.After the reports are reviewed and cleared by OIP, they should be posted on each agency's website.&nbsp; OIP, in turn, will make all the Chief FOIA Officer Reports available to the public on the Department of Justice's website.&nbsp; The timing for posting the finalized reports has been moved up one week as compared with 2010.&nbsp; For 2011, agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports should be posted in final form by March 8, 2011.Format of 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports As was done in 2010, agencies should address the five key areas discussed below in their Chief FOIA Officer Reports, specifically:&nbsp; 1) the steps taken to apply the presumption of openness; 2) the steps taken to ensure that there is an efficient and effective system in place for responding to requests; 3) the steps taken to increase proactive disclosures; 4) the steps taken to improve use of technology; and 5) the steps taken to reduce any backlogs of pending FOIA requests.&nbsp;For those agencies that process requests on a decentralized basis, rather than organizing the report by component and then reporting on the five key areas for each component, the report should be organized by the five key areas.&nbsp; Then, within the discussion of each key area the data for the various components should be included.&nbsp; That will make it easier to get a picture of how the agency as a whole is addressing each of the five key areas.&nbsp;A new element has been added for the 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to allow each agency to spotlight a particular success story from the previous year.&nbsp; At the end of each report there is now a section for agencies to include a transparency success story that they would like to highlight.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Content of 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports Steps Taken to Apply the Presumption of OpennessThe guiding principle underlying the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines is the presumption of openness.&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Describe the steps your agency has taken to ensure that the presumption of openness is being applied to all decisions involving the FOIA.&nbsp; To do so, you should answer the questions listed below and then include any additional information you would like to describe how your agency is working to apply the presumption of openness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Describe how&nbsp;the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines have been publicized throughout your agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. What training has been attended and/or conducted on the new FOIA Guidelines?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. How has your agency created or modified your internal guidance to reflect the presumption of openness?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. To what extent has your agency made discretionary releases of otherwise exempt information?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. What exemptions would have covered the information that was released as a matter of discretion?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.&nbsp;&nbsp;How does your agency review records to determine whether discretionary releases are possible?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g. Describe any other initiatives undertaken by your agency to ensure that the presumption of openness is being applied.2.&nbsp; Report the extent to which the numbers of requests where records have been released in full and the numbers of requests where records have been released in part has changed from those numbers as reported in your previous year's Annual FOIA Report.Steps Taken to Ensure that Your Agency has an Effective System In Place for Responding to RequestsAs the Attorney General emphasized in his FOIA Guidelines, \"[a]pplication of the proper disclosure standard is only one part of ensuring transparency.&nbsp; Open Government requires not just a presumption of disclosure, but also an effective system for responding to FOIA requests.\"&nbsp;Describe here the steps your agency has taken to ensure that your system for responding to requests is effective and efficient.&nbsp; This section should include a discussion of how your agency has addressed the key roles played by the broad spectrum of agency personnel who work with FOIA professionals in responding to requests, including, in particular, steps taken to ensure that FOIA professionals have sufficient IT support. &nbsp;To do so, answer the questions below and then include any additional information that you would like to describe how your agency ensures that your FOIA system is efficient and effective.Do FOIA professionals within your agency have sufficient IT support?Describe how your agency's FOIA professionals interact with your Open Government Team.Describe the steps your agency has taken to assess whether adequate staffing is being devoted to responding to FOIA requests.Describe any other steps your agency has undertaken to ensure that your FOIA system operates efficiently and effectively.Steps Taken To Increase Proactive DisclosuresBoth the President and Attorney General focused on the need for agencies to work proactively to post information online without waiting for individual requests to be received.&nbsp;Describe here the steps your agency has taken to increase the amount of material that is available on your agency website, including providing examples of proactive disclosures that have been made since issuance of the new FOIA Guidelines. &nbsp;&nbsp;In doing so, answer the questions listed below and describe any additional steps taken by your agency to make proactive disclosures of information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Has your agency added new material to your agency website since last year?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. What types of records have been posted?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Give examples of the types of records your agency now posts that used to be available only by making a FOIA request for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d. What system do you have in place to routinely identify records that are appropriate for posting?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e. How do you utilize social media in disseminating information?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f. Describe any other steps taken to increase proactive disclosures at your agency.Steps Taken To Greater Utilize TechnologyA key component of the President's FOIA Memorandum was the direction to \"use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government.\"&nbsp; In addition to using the internet to make proactive disclosures, agencies should also be exploring ways to utilize technology in responding to requests.&nbsp; In 2010 agencies reported widespread use of technology in handling FOIA requests.&nbsp; For this section of your Chief FOIA Officer Report for 2011, please answer the following more targeted questions:Electronic receipt of FOIA requests:What proportion of the components within your agency which receive FOIA requests have the capability to receive such requests electronically?To what extent have you increased the number of components doing so since the filing of your last Chief FOIA Officer Report?What methods does your agency use to receive requests electronically?Electronic tracking of FOIA requests:&nbsp;What proportion of components within your agency which receive FOIA requests have the capability to track such requests electronically?To what extent have you increased the number of components doing so since the filing of your last Chief FOIA Officer Report?What methods does your agency use to track requests electronically?Electronic processing of FOIA requests:&nbsp;What proportion of components within your agency which receive FOIA requests have the capability to process such requests electronically?To what extent have you increased the number of components doing so since the filing of your last Chief FOIA Officer Report?What methods does your agency use to process requests electronically?Electronic preparation of your Annual FOIA Report:What type of technology does your agency use to prepare your agency Annual FOIA Report, i.e., specify whether the technology is FOIA-specific or a generic data-processing system.&nbsp;If you are not satisfied with your existing system to prepare your Annual FOIA Report, describe the steps you have taken to increase your use of technology for next year.Steps Taken to Reduce Backlogs and Improve Timeliness in Responding to RequestsImprovements to timeliness in responding to pending FOIA requests and reductions in backlogs are both ongoing agency efforts.&nbsp; The President and the Attorney General have emphasized the importance of improving timeliness in responding to requests.&nbsp; Section XII of your Annual FOIA Report includes figures that show your agency's backlog of pending requests and administrative appeals for the past two fiscal years.&nbsp; You should refer to those numbers when completing this section of your Chief FOIA Officer Report.&nbsp; In this section you should address the following elements.&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your agency has a backlog, report here whether that backlog is decreasing.&nbsp; That reduction should be measured in two ways.&nbsp; First, report whether the number of backlogged requests and backlogged administrative appeals that remain pending at the end of the fiscal year decreased or increased, and by how many, when compared with last fiscal year.&nbsp; Second, report whether your agency closed in Fiscal Year 2010 the ten oldest of those pending requests and appeals from Fiscal Year 2009, and if not, report how many of them your agency did close.&nbsp; &nbsp;2.&nbsp; If there has not been a reduction in the backlog as measured by either of these metrics, describe why that has occurred.&nbsp; In doing so, answer the following questions and then include any other additional explanation:Is the backlog increase a result of an increase in the number of incoming requests or appeals?Is the backlog increase caused by a loss of staff?Is the backlog increase caused by an increase in the complexity of the requests received?What other causes, if any, contributed to the increase in backlog?3. Describe the steps your agency is taking to reduce any backlogs and to improve timeliness in responding to requests and administrative appeals. &nbsp;In doing so answer the following questions and then also include any other steps being taken to improve timeliness.Does your agency routinely set goals and monitor the progress of your FOIA caseload?&nbsp;Has your agency increased its FOIA staffing?Has your agency made IT improvements to increase timeliness?Has your agency Chief FOIA Officer been involved in overseeing your agency's capacity to process requests?Spotlight on Success Out of all the activities undertaken by your agency in this last year to increase transparency, describe here one success story that you would like to highlight as emblematic of your efforts.&nbsp;Timing

continue to make concrete progress in implementing the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; The 2012 assessment shows that agencies are applying the presumption of openness, are taking steps to ensure that they have effective systems in place for responding to requests, are increasing both the content on their websites and its usability, and are offering requesters the opportunity to submit requests electronically.While more than half the agencies are utilizing advanced technology to help with core processing tasks like improved document searches, streamlined consultation processes, and more efficient document review, there are many that have not yet explored those options.&nbsp; In this era of lean resources, as agencies face competing priorities, they understandably may also face challenges in acquiring new technology.&nbsp; At the same time, agencies are encouraged to assess the cost effectiveness as well as the benefits of more advanced technological tools that could be used to achieve greater efficiency in the core elements of FOIA processing, particularly improved document searches and review.As to improving timeliness, agencies that do not currently offer multi-track processing, and which take longer than twenty working days on average to respond to requests, should consider establishing a multi-track system.&nbsp; A multi-track system will provide a mechanism for the agency to process \"simple\" requests in a different queue from \"complex\" requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the \"simple\" track requests.&nbsp; Additionally, by establishing multiple processing tracks, agencies can more readily offer requesters the option of tailoring their request so that it fits within the \"simple\" track and can be processed more quickly.Lastly, all agencies should make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each year.&nbsp; By doing so systematically, year after year, the government overall will be able to reduce the age of its backlog and eliminate those lingering requests that have remained pending for many years.&nbsp; #> 5

                                                    Guidance for Further Improvement Based on 2013 Chief FOIA OfficerReport Review and Assessment As illustrated by OIP's 2013 Assessment of Agency Progress in Implementing the President's and Attorney General's FOIA Memoranda, agencies have accomplished a great deal over the past year to apply the presumption of openness, make more proactive disclosures, utilize technology for the benefit of FOIA administration, improve timeliness, and reduce backlogs. While the government overall has made significant improvements, the results achieved by individual agencies vary. OIP's Assessment serves as a visual snapshot of where each agency should focus its efforts in the upcoming year to achieve even greater success in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines. To assist agencies, OIP offers the following guidance based on our 2013 Assessment.Focus on Quality TrainingA proper understanding of the FOIA, including the correct application of the statute's provisions and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines, is the first step towards any successful FOIA operation. OIP's Assessment shows that the vast majority of agencies are either holding training conferences or sending their FOIA professionals to training hosted by other agencies. These efforts vary by agency, though, with some agencies citing one or two training sessions attended by staff and others hosting multiple FOIA conferences and having all of their FOIA professionals attend regular training.OIP advises every agency to make FOIA training available to all their FOIA professionals at least once each year. Moreover, it is essential that FOIA training programs cover core, substantive aspects of FOIA administration. Agencies that have been engaged in robust training initiatives should continue these efforts. Agencies that are in need of training are encouraged to take advantage of the many FOIA training opportunities available around the government or to plan a comprehensive FOIA conference tailored to the needs of their own agency. OIP regularly conducts a number of government-wide training sessions that cover all aspects of the FOIA. OIP's subject matter experts are also available to provide specialized training for agencies on any FOIA topic. For more information about OIP's upcoming training events and how to attend please visit the \"Training\" page of our website. In addition, agencies can contact OIP’s Training Officer to arrange for assistance in holding an in-house training program.Focus on Processing “Simple” Track Requests Within Twenty Working DaysThe Attorney General has emphasized that \"[t]imely disclosure of information is an essential component of transparency.\" The government overall showed improvement on this front with sixty-three agencies processing their \"simple track\" requests within an average of twenty days or less and several more being very close to meeting this goal. However, there are still a number of agencies with longer processing times. Agencies that are taking longer than an average of twenty days to process their simple requests should reexamine their FOIA process and strive to meet this milestone. Furthermore, OIP advises those agencies with high processing times that have not established multi-track processing to consider doing so. As explained in last year's guidance, multi-track systems provide a mechanism for agencies to process their simple requests in a different queue from their complex requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the simple requests. Differentiating the processing queues also allows agencies to provide requesters with meaningful choices regarding processing times, based on the complexity of the request.Focus on Closing the “Ten Oldest”Finally, all agencies should continue to make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each fiscal year. Our sustained efforts to close these requests and appeals every year is essential to reducing the age of the government's backlogs and resolving those cases that have been lingering for years.In addition to closing their oldest requests and appeals, for those agencies that receive consultations from other agencies it is equally important to close their ten oldest pending consultations. This ensures that the agencies that sent the consultations can have the responses they need in order to close out the requests. #> 6

Communication with FOIA RequestersAs we approach Sunshine Week, which commemorates the anniversary of the birthday of President James Madison, who is considered the Founding Father of open government, we are likewise approaching the one-year anniversary of Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines. Those FOIA Guidelines were designed to underscore our country's \"fundamental commitment to open government.\" The Guidelines address a range of issues related to the presumption of openness, the need for agencies to establish an effective system for responding to requests, and the obligation to disclose information promptly and proactively.Significantly, the FOIA Guidelines also stress that agencies \"must be mindful of their obligation to work 'in a spirit of cooperation' with FOIA requesters,\" as directed by President Obama in his FOIA Memorandum. Moreover, Attorney General Holder cautioned agencies that \"[u]neccessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the 'new era of open Government' that the President has proclaimed.\" Thus, it is important for agencies to be mindful of the manner in which they interact with the pivotal player in every FOIA request - the FOIA requester. Establishing good communication and working cooperatively with FOIA requesters is a very simple and yet essential element to ensuring that each agency's FOIA process is working in accordance with the President's and Attorney General's directives.There are a number of areas where improved communication with FOIA requesters holds great promise for improving FOIA administration.Providing Agency Contact Information OIP has long advised agencies to provide each FOIA requester with the name and phone number of the FOIA professional handling his or her request. Although many agencies already routinely provide such contact information to FOIA requesters, all agencies should ensure that they do so. This is a fundamental courtesy which should readily be extended to all FOIA requesters.Discussing the Scope and Status of the Request The FOIA has a number of provisions that require agencies to contact requesters. Whenever a request involves \"unusual circumstances\" and the agency determines that it must extend the time to respond by more than ten working days, the agency is required to notify the requester and give him or her an opportunity to limit the scope of the request or to arrange for an alternative time to process it. The FOIA also requires agencies to establish a telephone line or Internet service to provide requesters with the status of their requests. In carrying out these statutory requirements agencies should ensure that their communication with requesters is prompt and helpful.Good communication with requesters can also be exceedingly helpful in those instances where an agency is uncertain about the scope of what is being requested. By engaging in a dialogue with the requester, both parties can ensure that they have a common understanding of what records are being sought. Similarly, when a request will involve a far-ranging or time-consuming search, it is often helpful to contact the requester to discuss what steps will be involved in order to process that particular request. Often these conversations will allow the FOIA requester and the FOIA professional to collaborate on a plan for responding to a complex request. Many times FOIA requesters do not know how agency records are organized or what might be involved in searching for the records they seek. Having the ability to talk through an approach to the request and reach an understanding can be very helpful to both the requester and the agency.Making Interim Responses as Processing Proceeds When an agency is working on a request that involves a voluminous amount of material or which involves searches in multiple locations, whenever feasible, the agency should provide the requester with interim responses rather than waiting until all records are located and processed. Although there are situations where records need to be reviewed in their totality to ensure proper handling, in other cases rolling releases of records are possible. Whenever such rolling releases are possible the agency should make them to facilitate access to the requested records.Limiting \"Still-Interested\" Letters or Phone Calls On occasion, when the passage of time or a change in circumstance gives rise to a question of whether a FOIA requester is still interested in obtaining the requested records, many agencies contact the requester to inquire whether he or she is still interested in having the request processed. When done judiciously, this is entirely appropriate because agency resources should not be expended on processing a request when the requester is no longer interested in the records. At the same time, agencies should be mindful that FOIA requesters can misinterpret the intent behind a letter or phone call inquiring whether the requester remains interested in the request. So this is yet another area where it is important to be mindful of the manner in which such inquiries are made. In particular, absent good cause, an agency should not inquire more than once whether a requester is still interested in the request. Agencies should also afford requesters a reasonable amount of time to indicate their continued interest and should ensure that there is a simple way for requesters to do so.Conclusion All of these simple practices can go a long way to ensuring that agencies are working with FOIA requesters in the \"spirit of cooperation\" that the President and Attorney General directed. There is no doubt that implementing an efficient and effective FOIA system is a major undertaking for agencies. Improving communication and working cooperatively with FOIA requesters should be viewed as an essential part of that undertaking. #>   changed created date teaser #> 1    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 2    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 3    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 4    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 5    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 6    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #>                                                                                            title #> 1      Presidential Statement and White House Memorandum on the FOIA Issued During Sunshine Week #> 2                    Guidelines for 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to the Department of Justice #> 3                                                 Annual FOIA Reports in Machine-Readable Format #> 4                                                           OIP Guidance for Further Improvement #> 5 Guidance for Further Improvement Based on 2013 Chief FOIA Officer Report Review and Assessment #> 6                                      The Importance of Good Communication with FOIA Requesters #>                                                                                                                        url #> 1     https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2010-presidential-statement-and-white-house-memorandum-foia-issued-during #> 2            https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2010-guidelines-2011-chief-foia-officer-reports-department-justice #> 3                              https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2009-annual-foia-reports-machine-readable-format #> 4                                                        https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/oip-guidance-further-improvement #> 5 https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/guidance-further-improvement-based-2013-chief-foia-officer-report-review-and-assessment #> 6               https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-post-2010-oip-guidance-importance-good-communication-foia-requesters #>                                   uuid name #> 1 61fbf58b-f3df-461f-b20c-2a63ff6d21bf <NA> #> 2 cb9921e3-5468-44ca-a884-8634df54c015 <NA> #> 3 06b60eca-fd41-493e-bd1f-f1de126b6b22 <NA> #> 4 bdab8a8f-30d4-49b3-8b6e-c8d650d64c30 <NA> #> 5 ffd6facd-9f54-4d76-b6a9-24168a6dd44d <NA> #> 6 fdab6461-6b13-4ee5-b7ae-73776cf7b3a2 <NA>"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"accessing U.S. Department Justice (DOJ) open data press releases.","code":""},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"","code":"doj_press_releases(     n_results = 50,     search_direction = \"DESC\",     keyword = NULL,     clean = TRUE   )"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"n_results number results return. default, 50 results returned. search_direction Set ASC DESC fetch data starting least recent entries. default, data sorted descending order (recent entries). keyword return results containing keyword.

Bolden in New Haven to 270 months of imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release, for his involvement in a violent Bridgeport street gang, and his role in the murder and attempted murder of rival gang members.Today’s announcement was made by Marc H. Silverman, Acting United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut; Joseph T. Corradino, State’s Attorney for the Fairfield Judicial District; Bridgeport Police Chief Roderick Porter; Anish Shukla, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the New Haven Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation; James Ferguson, Special Agent in Charge, ATF Boston Field Division; Stephen Belleau, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Drug Enforcement Administration for New England, and Acting U.S. Marshal Lawrence Bobnick.According to court documents, statements made in court, and the evidence presented during a month-long trial, the FBI, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bridgeport Police have been investigating multiple Bridgeport-based gangs whose members are involved in narcotics trafficking, murder and other acts of violence.&nbsp; Jones has been a member of the “East End gang,” which began as a local street gang based in the East End of Bridgeport, but currently has members and associates who are either incarcerated or living throughout Bridgeport and surrounding towns.&nbsp; The East End gang has been aligned with other groups, including the PT Barnum Gang, the East Side gang and 150, which is a geographic gang based on the West Side of Bridgeport.&nbsp; These groups were aligned against rival organizations in Bridgeport, including the “Original North End” (“O.N.E.”) and the “Greene Homes Boyz,” (“GHB/Hotz”), based in the Charles F. Greene Homes Housing Complex in Bridgeport’s North End.Due to the level of gun violence Bridgeport was experiencing, the investigation commenced shortly before East End members shot and killed Myreke Kenion and shot and attempted to kill D’Andre Brown, both members and associates of the GHB/Hotz gang, on January 26, 2020.&nbsp; The next day, in retaliation for these shootings, GHB/Hotz and O.N.E. members attempted to kill East End gang members and associates in a brazen afternoon shooting in front of a state courthouse on Golden Hill Street in Bridgeport that resulted in four victims being shot while sitting inside a car.Jones and other East End members distributed heroin, crack cocaine, marijuana and Percocet pills; used and shared firearms; and committed at least six murders and other acts of violence against rival gang members and other individuals.&nbsp; East End members celebrated their criminal conduct on social media websites such as Facebook and YouTube, and committed acts of intimidation and made threats to deter potential witnesses to their crimes and to protect gang members and associates from detection and prosecution by law enforcement authorities.The investigation determined that on July 12, 2019, Jones and fellow East End member Tyrone Moore shot and killed Sean Warren, also known as “Kujoe,” a member and associate of the O.N.E. gang.&nbsp; In addition, on October 17, 2019, Jones shot and attempted to kill Joshua Gilbert, also a member and associate of the O.N.E. gang.Jones initially&nbsp;pleaded guilty on August 29, 2022, but Judge Bolden subsequently granted his motion to withdraw his guilty plea.&nbsp; On December 5, 2023, a jury found Jones and three associates guilty of conspiring to engage in a pattern of racketeering activity.Jones has been detained since October 17, 2019.Approximately 47 members and associates of the East End, O.N.E. and the GHB/Hotz gangs have been convicted of federal offenses stemming from this investigation, which has and solved eight murders and approximately 20 attempted murders.Tyrone Moore pleaded guilty and on June 26, 2023,&nbsp;was sentenced to 250 months of imprisonment.This investigation has been conducted by the FBI’s Safe Streets and Violent Crimes Task Forces, ATF, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service, Bridgeport Police Department, Connecticut State Police, and the Bridgeport State’s Attorney’s Office, with the assistance of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Connecticut Forensic Science Laboratory, and the Waterbury Police Department.&nbsp; These cases are being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jocelyn C. Kaoutzanis, Stephanie T. Levick, Rahul Kale, and Karen L. Peck.This prosecution is a part of the Justice’s Department’s Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), Project Longevity and Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces (OCDETF) programs.PSN is the centerpiece of the Department of Justice’s violent crime reduction efforts.&nbsp; PSN is an evidence-based program proven to be effective at reducing violent crime.&nbsp; Through PSN, a broad spectrum of stakeholders work together to identify the most pressing violent crime problems in the community and develop comprehensive solutions to address them.&nbsp; As part of this strategy, PSN focuses enforcement efforts on the most violent offenders and partners with locally based prevention and reentry programs for lasting reductions in crime.Project Longevity is a comprehensive initiative to reduce gun violence in Connecticut’s major cities.&nbsp; Through Project Longevity, community members and law enforcement directly engage with members of groups that are prone to commit violence and deliver a community message against violence, a law enforcement message about the consequences of further violence and an offer of help for those who want it.&nbsp; If a group member elects to engage in gun violence, the focused attention of federal, state and local law enforcement will be directed at that entire group.OCDETF identifies, disrupts, and dismantles drug traffickers, money launderers, gangs, and transnational criminal organizations through a prosecutor-led and intelligence-driven approach that leverages the strengths of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies.&nbsp;

PAUL, Minn. – A federal jury found a Rochester man guilty of illegally possessing a firearm as a felon, announced Acting U.S. Attorney Lisa D. Kirkpatrick.&nbsp;According to court documents and evidence presented at trial, on March 18-19, 2023, Divaunte Kartrell Young, 24, pressured an acquaintance “Victim A” for a ride to the Twin Cities. When Victim A refused, Young brandished a handgun he carried in a black and white Adidas cross-body bag. After Victim A and Young drove to a nearby gas station, Victim A went inside the gas station and locked herself in the bathroom in order to call a friend for help. Shortly afterwards, Victim A abandoned her vehicle and called 911. Responding officers located the car, found Young sleeping inside, and took him into custody. During the subsequent search of the vehicle, officers located the black and white Adidas bag with a silver Taurus nine-millimeter handgun inside. Young’s DNA was matched to DNA that was found on the gun. &nbsp;After Young was taken into custody, he contacted Victim A and was captured on recorded jail calls attempting to obstruct Victim A from participating in the criminal case against him.Because Young has multiple prior felony convictions for domestic assault, aggravated robbery, burglary, and fourth degree assault, he is prohibited under federal law from possessing firearms or ammunition at any time.Following a three-day trial before Judge Eric C.

The court also ordered Orr to forfeit two Glock pistols and assorted ammunition. Orr pleaded guilty on November 26, 2024.According to court documents, on May 25, 2022, Orr, a convicted felon with four prior convictions for fleeing and attempting to elude a law enforcement officer, fled from a deputy with the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) during an attempted traffic stop.&nbsp;Orr drove his vehicle through a red light and fled at a high speed. The deputy did not pursue Orr, but the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office (SCSO) Aviation Unit, which had been working with MCSO conducting narcotics surveillance, tracked Orr’s vehicle as he continued to flee. Orr ran through red lights, drove over medians, and passed vehicles by driving on the shoulder and in opposite lanes of travel. He drove into Sarasota, back into Manatee County, then east to DeSoto County and south to Charlotte County, where the SCSO Aviation Unit, running low on fuel, stopped surveillance. Orr made several evasive maneuvers during his flight, including driving through a yard and completely around a house, and driving on the opposite side of the highway to evade stop sticks placed by law enforcement.At one point, Orr pulled off the highway and drove into a field off State Road 31 in Punta Gorda. There, Orr threw a backpack out of the vehicle. Deputies from the Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office, having been informed by the SCSO Aviation Unit that the driver discarded something from the vehicle, responded to the field and recovered a backpack which contained a Glock pistol, fentanyl, methamphetamine, a digital scale, and various pills including oxycodone.On August 5, 2022, while MCSO investigators and the SCSO Aviation Unit were investigating suspected narcotics trafficking and conducting surveillance, they observed Orr driving a pickup truck with three others in the vehicle. They tracked the vehicle to a clothing store, where all the occupants exited. When Orr and the others left the store and returned to the truck, MCSO investigators moved toward the vehicle and apprehended Orr and the others immediately after they entered the truck. Inside the truck, investigators located two firearms and a bag containing cocaine and other controlled substances.DNA analysis determined that Orr’s DNA was consistent with DNA on the firearm found inside the backpack he had thrown from his vehicle on May 25, 2022, and DNA on one of the firearms found in the truck Orr drove on August 5, 2022.This case was investigated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Manatee County Sheriff’s Office, the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office, and the Charlotte County Sheriff’s Office. It was prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorneys Michael Sinacore and David Chee. The asset forfeiture was handled by Assistant United States Attorney James Muench.This case is part of Project Safe Neighborhoods (PSN), a program bringing together all levels of law enforcement and the communities they serve to reduce violent crime and gun violence, and to make our neighborhoods safer for everyone.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                WASHINGTON – Zubair Ahmed, 29, and Khaleel Ahmed, 28, both residents of Chicago, pleaded guilty today in the Northern District of Ohio to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists in connection with their efforts to travel abroad in order to murder or maim U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.      Today’s guilty pleas were announced by Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security; William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio; and C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).      Zubair Ahmed and his cousin Khaleel Ahmed each pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge James G. Carr in Toledo, Ohio, to a one-count, superseding information charging them with conspiracy to provide material support and resources, including the defendants themselves as personnel, to terrorists in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. Section 2339A. At sentencing, each defendant faces a statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, followed by three years of supervised release.      According to the superseding information and other information entered into the court record today:      The criminal conspiracy involving Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed began no later than April 1, 2004, and continued until their arrests on Feb. 21, 2007. As part of the conspiracy, the defendants made preparations to travel overseas in order to engage in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in either Iraq or Afghanistan. On or about May 21, 2004, the defendants traveled to Cairo, Egypt, with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.      After their return from Egypt, on or about July 4, 2004, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed discussed, sought and received instruction on firearms from another individual in Cleveland. The defendants also sought and discussed training in counter-surveillance techniques and sniper rifles with this individual. Specifically, defendant Zubair Ahmed discussed his desire to learn how to use and move with a .50-caliber machine gun.      As part of the conspiracy, the defendants also communicated with each other using code words and in a foreign language to disguise their preparations and plans to engage in acts abroad that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.      Furthermore, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed researched the purchase of firearms, methods of obtaining firearms instruction (including at least one visit to a firing range) and methods of obtaining instruction in gunsmithing. In addition, the defendants collected and distributed videos of attacks on U.S. military forces overseas, manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry.      \"Today’s guilty pleas should send a strong message to individuals who would use this country as a platform to plot attacks against U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \"This case also underscores the need for continued vigilance in identifying and dismantling extremist plots that develop within our nation.\"      William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said: \"These guilty pleas are testament to the hard work and dedication of all the federal, state and local law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating this case and to the tireless efforts and perseverance of an extremely talented team of federal prosecutors who, with their law enforcement partners, keep this country safe from terrorists.\"      C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division, FBI, said: \"This case is an example of our continued efforts to detect terrorist planning and to prevent acts of terrorism before they occur.&nbsp; Through close cooperation with our law enforcement partners in Illinois and Ohio, this case resulted in the successful prosecution of these individuals.\"      This case was investigated by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Chicago, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio, with the assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Chicago Police Department; the Illinois State Police; the Ohio Highway Patrol; the Toledo Police Department; and the Lucas and Wood County Sheriff’s Departments.&nbsp;      This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E. Getz and Justin E. Herdman of the National Security Unit of the U.S Attorney’s Office in Cleveland; as well Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg N. Sofer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Austin, Texas (formerly of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section); and Trial Attorneys Jerome J. Teresinski and Jolie F.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON - The Justice Department today announced that it has reached a settlement with the State of Georgia regarding the conditions at Georgia’s seven psychiatric hospitals. The Department opened its investigation of Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals in 2007 and issued findings regarding Georgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta on May 30, 2008. The Department subsequently entered into negotiations regarding remedies the State was required to implement to correct unconstitutional conditions at all the hospitals. The other state facilities involved in today’s settlement include: Georgia Regional Hospital at Savannah, Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Southwestern State Hospital, East Central State Hospital, West Central State Hospital, and Northwest Georgia Regional Hospital at Rome.      \"When a state undertakes to care for persons with mental illness and developmental disabilities, it accepts responsibility to protect them from harm,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"The Department commends Governor Sonny Perdue, State Attorney General Thurbert Baker, and the Georgia Department of Human Resources for their willingness to work aggressively to address the conditions at these seven psychiatric hospitals. The leadership of the State in amicably resolving this matter has been paramount to today's exceptional result on behalf of the people of the State of Georgia. We are pleased that we have cooperatively achieved a settlement agreement that will benefit the lives of persons with mental health problems and developmental disabilities in Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals.\"      Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the State will work to ensure that patients at the seven hospitals are safe and receive the care and services necessary to meet their individualized needs. Specifically, the State has agreed to undertake a variety of measures, including improving medical and mental health care and ensuring that patients are free from undue bodily restraint. The State will also improve discharge planning and ensure that each patient is served in the most integrated setting appropriate.      Today's settlement with the State of Georgia is the result of a cooperative effort by State entities and the Justice Department to reach a settlement that will make meaningful changes to improve the care and treatment of patients at Georgia’s seven psychiatric hospitals. This Administration is firmly committed to the vigorous protection of the rights of persons with disabilities.      The Civil Rights Division is authorized to conduct investigations of public psychiatric hospitals under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). This statute allows the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses such as those discovered in Georgia. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations in other in-patient mental health facilities in the District of Columbia, Vermont, and California, among other states. The Civil Rights Division has open investigations of mental health facilities in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Oregon.      CRIPA authorizes the Attorney General to investigate conditions in certain institutions owned or operated by, or on behalf of, state or local governments. These institutions include nursing homes, residential facilities serving people with mental or other developmental disabilities, mental health facilities, jails, prisons, and juvenile justice facilities.      Copies of the settlement documents were filed today in federal court and will be available on the Justice Department Web site upon approval by a federal judge.

            WASHINGTON – SouthernCare Inc. and its shareholders have agreed to pay the United States a total of $24.7 million to settle allegations that the Birmingham, Ala.-based company submitted false claims to the government for patients treated at its hospice facilities, the Justice Department announced today. SouthernCare operates approximately 99 locations that provide hospice services in 15 states.      Hospices provide palliative care – any form of medical care or treatment that concentrates on reducing the severity of a disease’s symptoms – to patients who decide to forego curative care of their illness. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to hospice care if they have a terminal prognosis of six months or less to live. The government alleged that SouthernCare was submitting false claims for hospice care for patients who were not eligible for such care.      \"The Medicare hospice benefit is intended to provide compassionate end of life care to terminally ill patients,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division. \"This settlement sends a clear message that the Department of Justice will not allow health care providers to take advantage of beneficiaries in their attempts to game the reimbursement system.\"      Today’s settlement results from two qui tam suits filed by two former SouthernCare employees, Tanya Rice and Nancy Romeo, on behalf of the United States. The False Claims Act authorizes private parties to file suit against those who defraud the United States and to receive a share of any recovery. The United States will pay $4.9 million to the individuals who filed the actions against SouthernCare.      \"Our investigation showed a pattern and practice to falsely admit patients to hospice care who did not qualify and to bill Medicare for that care. This resulted in taxpayers bearing inappropriate costs. Today’s settlement evidences the Department of Justice’s efforts to both protect the public monies and safeguard Medicare beneficiaries,\" said Alice H. Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.      \"This significant settlement demonstrates our commitment to protect the Medicare trust fund from fraud and abuse and to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality care,\" said David E. Nahmias, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia,. \"Every provider that submits claims to the Medicare program must ensure that its services are billed appropriately. Falsely admitting people to hospice care who did not qualify for the benefit exposed these patients to potential harm and contributes to the soaring costs of health care for everyone.\"      As part of the settlement, SouthernCare will enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to address the allegations raised in the qui tam complaints.      \"Today’s Corporate Integrity Agreement contains rigorous provisions specifically designed to ensure SouthernCare’s future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid hospice eligibility requirements,\" said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General for HHS.&nbsp;\"This agreement demonstrates OIG’s commitment to protect the integrity of federal health care programs.\"      The investigation was jointly handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northen District of Georgia, the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI. #> 4

                                                                                                    WASHINGTON — Executives from LG Display Co. Ltd. and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. have agreed to plead guilty and serve jail time in the United States for participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) panels, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today.      According to a one-count felony charge filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chang Suk \"C.S.\" Chung, a Korean LG executive, conspired with unnamed employees from other panel makers to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels from on or about Sept. 21, 2001, to on or about June 1, 2006. According to a separate one-count felony charge, also filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chieng-Hon \"Frank\" Lin, a Taiwanese former executive from Chunghwa, and Chih-Chun \"C.C.\" Liu and Hsueh-Lung \"Brian\" Lee, Taiwanese current employees of Chungwha, are charged with participating in the same conspiracy at various times during the period from Sept. 14, 2001, to on or about Dec. 1, 2006.      Under the plea agreements, which must be approved by the court, all four executives have agreed to serve a term of imprisonment, pay a criminal fine and assist the government in its ongoing TFT-LCD investigation.      TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. In 2006, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was approximately $70 billion.      \"These cases involve the first Taiwanese nationals to face imprisonment in the United States for an antitrust offense,\" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department of Justice is committed to holding accountable all conspirators who harm American consumers, no matter where they live or where they commit the crime.\"      During the conspiracy, Chang Suk Chung, a Korean citizen, worked as LG’s Vice President of Monitor Sales. Under the plea agreement, Chung has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $25,000 criminal fine.      During the charged conspiracy period, Chieng-Hon Lin, a Taiwanese and U.S. citizen, was Chunghwa’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Under the plea agreement, Lin has agreed to serve a nine-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $50,000 criminal fine.      Chih-Chun Liu, a Taiwanese citizen, was Chunghwa’s Vice President of LCD Sales during the charged conspiracy period. Under the plea agreement, Liu has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $30,000 criminal fine.      Hsueh-Lung Lee, a Taiwanese citizen, held various sales positions at Chunghwa during the charged conspiracy period, including Vice President of LCD Sales. Under the plea agreement, Lee has agreed to serve a six-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $20,000 criminal fine.      These four foreign-based executives were charged with participating with co-conspirators in a conspiracy that was accomplished by:    Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT-LCD panels;  Agreeing during these meetings, conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT-LCD panels at certain predetermined levels;  Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached;  Exchanging information on sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices; and  Authorizing, ordering and consenting to the participation of subordinate employees in the conspiracy.        \"These are the first individuals to plead guilty to a charge of fixing prices in this active investigation into antitrust violations in the TFT-LCD industry,\" said Scott D. Hammond, the Antitrust Division’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement. \"We will continue in our efforts to bring to justice other domestic and foreign-based executives who were involved with fixing TFT-LCD prices.\"      On Dec. 15, 2008, LG pleaded guilty to participating in this conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $400 million criminal fine – the second largest fine in Antitrust Division history. On Jan. 14, 2009, Chunghwa pleaded guilty to participating in the same conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $65 million criminal fine.      On Dec. 16, 2008, Sharp Corp. pleaded guilty to three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels sold to Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc., and was sentenced to pay a $120 million criminal fine.      The four executives are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of $1 million and up to 10 years in prison for an individual. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.      These pleas are the result of a joint investigation by the Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Field Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Francisco.      Anyone with information concerning illegal conduct in the TFT-LCD industry is urged to call the San Francisco Field Office of the Antitrust Division at 415-436-6660. #> 5 American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company today agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.415 billion for promoting its drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice announced today. This resolution includes a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a United States criminal prosecution of any kind. Eli Lilly will also pay up to $800 million in a civil settlement with the federal government and the states.Eli Lilly agreed to enter a global resolution with the United States to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it promoted its antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA, the Department said. Such unapproved uses are also known as \"off-label\" uses because they are not included in the drug’s FDA approved product label.Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Gregory G. Katsas and acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Laurie Magid today announced the filing of a criminal information against Eli Lilly for promoting Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA. Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, is charged in the information with promoting Zyprexa for such off-label or unapproved uses as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, in elderly people.The company has signed a plea agreement admitting its guilt to a misdemeanor criminal charge. Eli Lilly also signed a civil settlement to resolve civil claims that by marketing Zyprexa for unapproved uses, it caused false claims for payment to be submitted to federal insurance programs such as Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, none of which provided coverage for such off-label uses.The plea agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay a criminal fine of $515 million and forfeit assets of $100 million. The civil settlement agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay up to an additional $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve civil allegations originally brought in four separate lawsuits under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act. The federal share of the civil settlement amount is $438 million. Under the terms of the civil settlement, Eli Lilly will pay up to $361 million to those states that opt to participate in the agreement.Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a company must specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to the FDA. Before approving a drug, the FDA must determine that the drug is safe and effective for the use proposed by the company. Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for off-label uses.The FDA originally approved Zyprexa, also known by the chemical name olanzapine, in Sept. 1996 for the treatment of manifestations of psychotic disorders. In March 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. In Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short term treatment of schizophrenia in place of the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders. Also in Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable for approximately eight weeks and were then followed for a period of up to eight months. Zyprexa has never been approved for the treatment of dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia.The criminal information, filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that from Sept. 1999 through at least Nov. 2003, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for the treatment of agitation, aggression, hostility, dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression and generalized sleep disorder. The information alleges that Eli Lilly’s management created marketing materials promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, trained its sales force to disregard the law and directed its sales personnel to promote Zyprexa for off-label uses.The information alleges that beginning in 1999, Eli Lilly expended significant resources to promote Zyprexa in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, primarily through its long-term care sales force. Eli Lilly sought to convince doctors to prescribe Zyprexa to treat patients with disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and behavioral symptoms such as agitation, aggression, and hostility.The information further alleges that the FDA never approved Zyprexa for the treatment of dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, or the cognitive deficits associated with dementia.The information also alleges that building on its unlawful promotion and success in the long-term care market, Eli Lilly executives decided to market Zyprexa to primary-care physicians. In Oct. 2000, Eli Lilly began this off-label marketing campaign targeting primary care physicians, even though the company knew that there was virtually no approved use for Zyprexa in the primary-care market. Eli Lilly trained its primary-care physician sales representatives to promote Zyprexa by focusing on symptoms, rather than Zyprexa’s FDA approved indications.The qui tam lawsuits alleged that between Sept. 1999 and the end of 2005, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for use in patients of all ages and for the treatment of anxiety, irritability, depression, nausea, Alzheimer’s and other mood disorders. The qui tam lawsuits also alleged that the company funded continuing medical education programs, through millions of dollars in grants, to promote off-label uses of its drugs, in violation of the FDA’s requirements.\"Off-label promotion of pharmaceutical drugs is a serious crime because it undermines the FDA’s role in protecting the American public by determining that a drug is safe and effective for a particular use before it is marketed,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. \"This settlement demonstrates the Department’s ongoing diligence in prosecuting cases involving violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and recovering taxpayer dollars used to pay for drugs sold as a result of off-label marketing campaigns.\"\"When pharmaceutical companies ignore the government’s process for protecting the public, they undermine the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship and place innocent people in harm’s way,\" said acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Laurie Magid. \"Off-label marketing created unnecessary risks for patients. People have an absolute right to their doctor’s medical expertise, and to know that their health care provider’s judgment has not be clouded by misinformation from a company trying to build its bottom line.\"The global resolution includes the following agreements:\\tA plea agreement signed by Eli Lilly admitting guilt to the criminal charge of misbranding. Specifically, Eli Lilly admits that between Sept. 1999 and March 31, 2001, the company promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. Eli Lilly has agreed to pay a $515 million criminal fine and to forfeit an additional $100 million in assets.\\tA civil settlement between Eli Lilly, the United States and various States, in which Eli Lilly will pay up to $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve False Claims Act claims and related state claims by Medicaid and other federal programs and agencies including TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Department of Veterans Affairs, Bureau of Prisons and the Public Health Service Entities. The federal government will receive $438,171,544 from the civil settlement. The state Medicaid programs and the District of Columbia will share up to $361,828,456 of the civil settlement, depending on the number of states that participate in the settlement.\\tThe qui tam relators will receive $78,870,877 from the federal share of the settlement amount.\\tA Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) between Eli Lilly and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that a Board of Directors committee annually review the company’s compliance program and certify its effectiveness; that certain managers annually certify that their departments or functional areas are compliant; that Eli Lilly send doctors a letter notifying them about the global settlement; and that the company post on its website information about payments to doctors, such as honoraria, travel or lodging. Eli Lilly is subject to exclusion from Federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches.\"OIG’s Corporate Integrity Agreement will increase the transparency of Eli Lilly’s interactions with physicians and strengthen Eli Lilly’s accountability for its compliance with the law,\" said Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson. \"This historic resolution demonstrates the Government’s commitment to improvethe integrity of drug promotion activities.\"In addition to the $1.415 billion criminal and civil settlement announced today, Eli Lilly previously agreed to pay $62 million to settle consumer protection lawsuits brought by 33 states. The state consumer protection settlements were announced on Oct. 7, 2008.\"Today's announcement of the filing of a criminal charge and the unprecedented terms of this settlement demonstrates the government's increasing efforts aimed at pharmaceutical companies that choose to put profits ahead of the public's health,\" said Special Agent-in-Charge Kim Rice of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations. \"The FDA will continue to devote resources to criminal investigations targeting pharmaceutical companies that disregard the safeguards of the drug approval process and recklessly promote drugs for uses for which they have not been proven to be safe and effective.\"\"The illegal scheme used by Eli Lilly significantly impacted the integrity of TRICARE, the Department of Defense's healthcare system,\" said Ed Bradley, Special Agent-in-Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service. \"This illegal activity increases patients’ costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the over nine million military members, retirees and their families who rely on this system. Today’s charges and settlement demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its partners in law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those that abuse the government's healthcare programs at the expense of the taxpayers and patients.\"\"This case should serve as still another warning to all those who break the law in order to improve their profits,\" said Patrick Doyle, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services in Philadelphia. &nbsp;\"OIG, working with our law enforcement partners, will pursue and bring to justice those who would steal from vulnerable beneficiaries and the taxpayers.\"The civil settlement resolves four qui tam actions filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania: United States ex rel. Rudolf, et al., v. Eli Lilly and Company, Civil Action No. 03-943 (E.D. Pa.); United States ex rel. Faltaous v. Eli Lilly and Company, Civil Action No. 06-2909 (E.D. Pa.); United States ex rel. Woodward v. Dr. George B. Jerusalem, et al., Civil Action No. 06-5526 (E.D. Pa.); and United States ex rel. Vicente v. Eli Lilly and Company, Civil Action No. 07-1791 (E.D. Pa.). All of those cases were filed by former Eli Lilly sales representatives.The criminal case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania and the Office of Consumer Litigation of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. The civil settlement was reached by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the Commercial Litigation Branch of the Justice Department’s Civil Division.This matter was investigated by the FDA’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General.Assistance was provided by representatives of FDA’s

ongoing cement kiln enforcement initiative, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, today lodged a consent decree with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California resolving Clean Air Act claims against CEMEX California Cement LLC with respect to the company’s Victorville, Calif., Portland cement plant.The settlement will resolve claims asserted in a 2007 complaint that CEMEX is releasing pollutants to the air, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, without required permits setting emission limits under the Clean Air Act.&nbsp; Under the terms of the settlement, CEMEX must meet new limits for these pollutants at the Victorville plant, one of the largest cement plants in the United States, including stringent new limits for nitrogen oxide that will reduce emissions by 1,890 tons per year, a nearly 40 percent reduction.&nbsp; The cement manufacturer must also pay a $2 million civil penalty.&nbsp; EPA estimates that achieving and maintaining compliance with the new emission limits, depending on the control technology used, could cost CEMEX millions of dollars.“Today’s settlement shows the federal government’s continued commitment to enforcing the federal environmental laws and protecting the nation’s air quality,” said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.“This settlement will result in cleaner air for California,” said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA’s Air Division in the Pacific Southwest region.&nbsp; “This facility is the largest source of nitrogen oxide—an air pollutant that causes smog—in California, so the state-of-the-art air pollution controls that CEMEX is installing will have a significant impact on air quality.”The settlement resolves the EPA’s claims that on two separate occasions, in 1997 and 2000, CEMEX violated the Clean Air Act by undertaking major plant modifications resulting in significant increases in the Victorville plant’s capacity to pollute without first undergoing required regulatory review or obtaining required permits under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, program and without installing state-of-the-art emission controls that would reduce contaminants such as nitrogen oxide.&nbsp;Nitrogen oxide is a harmful air pollutant that causes smog and leads to respiratory problems in children and the elderly.&nbsp; The Victorville area fails to meet federal air quality standards for both ozone and particulate matter.The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.&nbsp; A copy of the consent decree is available on the Department of Justice Web site at http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html.&nbsp; For more information on the settlement and the Clean Air Act, please visit: http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/index.html. #>   changed created       date number #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-041 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-048 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-043 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-046 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-038 #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-044 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      teaser #> 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Zubair Ahmed, 29, and Khaleel Ahmed, 28, both residents of Chicago, pleaded guilty today in the Northern District of Ohio to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists in connection with their efforts to travel abroad in order to murder or maim U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan. \\n\\n #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Department has reached a settlement with the State of Georgia regarding the conditions at Georgia\\u0092s seven psychiatric hospitals.
