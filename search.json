Opening remarks were provided by the Head of the Denpasar District Prosecutor's Office and by the Deputy Head of the General Crimes Directorate from the INP District Office in Bali.  The timing of this workshop is pertinent because Bali will host the International G20 Summit in November 2022, an event expected to generate a sharp increase in human sex trafficking.  This event was delivered with support of and in coordination with the State Department’s Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     MARTIN ESTRADA SWORN IN AS UNITED STATES ATTORNEY      On September 19, Martin Estrada was sworn in as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California by Chief United States District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez. After being confirmed by the United States Senate on September 13, Mr. Estrada was given a four-year appointment by President Joseph Biden.

There, in addition to representing corporate clients, Estrada handled high-impact pro bono matters in the areas of education, immigration and equal justice. Mr. Estrada graduated with distinction from Stanford Law School and earned his undergraduate degree in history from the University of California, Irvine, where he graduated magna cum laude.

The guidance further explains how agencies should process requests involving Privacy Act records, depending on whether the request is submitted by a first-party requester seeking their own records or a third-party seeking records about another person.  The guidance also addresses other common questions, such as how to handle third-party information within a Privacy Act record and how to report requests involving Privacy Act records in agencies’ Annual FOIA Reports.The topics covered in this guidance are regularly included in OIP’s training on FOIA-Privacy Act Interface.  OIP is also available to answer any questions or provide additional guidance to agencies.  Please contact 202-514-3642 or DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov for assistance. #> 4 The FOIA requires agency Chief FOIA Officers to report to the Attorney General on their performance in implementing the law.  Accordingly, since 2009, the Department of Justice has directed agency Chief FOIA Officers to “review all aspects of their agencies’ FOIA administration” and to report annually to the Department of Justice on the efforts undertaken “to improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their agencies.”  Every year, OIP provides specific guidance to agencies on the content and timing of agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports and today we have issued the guidelines for agency 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports. In their 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports, OIP requires agencies to report steps taken in five key areas of FOIA administration highlighted in the Attorney General’s 2022 FOIA Guidelines:FOIA Leadership and Applying the Presumption of Openness,\\tEnsuring Fair and Effective FOIA Administration,\\tProactive Disclosures,\\tSteps Taken to Greater Utilize Technology; and\\tSteps Taken to Remove Barriers to Access, Improve Timeliness in Responding to Requests, and Reduce Backlogs.The 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Guidelines once again include separate reporting requirements for agencies depending on the number of FOIA requests received in the prior fiscal year.  For 2023, there are two sets of reporting requirements.  Agencies that received 50 requests or less in Fiscal Year 2021 are encouraged to report on any efforts or success stories that are not captured in their Fiscal Year 2022 Annual FOIA Report.  All other agencies receiving more than 50 requests have more extensive reporting requirements. OIP has identified 65 agencies that received more than 50 requests in Fiscal Year 2021. These agencies must submit their draft 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to OIP for review by no later than January 17, 2023.  For the remaining agencies receiving 50 requests or less in Fiscal Year 2021, if they do have information to report, they must provide their reports by no later than February 10, 2023.  A listing of all agencies with a link to their reporting requirements is included at the end of the Guidelines. Additional details on the review and submission process are included in the Guidelines.  OIP will once again host refresher training courses on the preparation of both the 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports and the Fiscal Year 2022 Annual FOIA Reports. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 On September 14, the ICITAP-Bangladesh mission reported on ICITAPs Counter-Wildlife Trafficking (CWT) program, which was honored to be joined on their recent wildlife prosecutions training event held in Sreemangal, Sylhet, Bangladesh by women law enforcement officers from across the Bangladesh Forest Department and Bangladesh Police. The Wildlife Crime Control Unit, Junior Wildlife Scout stated, “This workshop is helping me personally because seeing women speak in public to a large audience with so much confidence is inspiring and something I would like to achieve myself.” The Wildlife Inspector of the Wildlife Crime Control Unit, Bangladesh Forest Department when referring to the presence and participation of the visiting U.S. federal judge and the Assistant District Attorney at the ICITAP CWT event stated, “When I see (them), such successful women, I look at them in surprise and I am inspired to do something.” In yet another highlight, the Additional Superintendent of Police – also a participant at the event – reported to have also received previous support and assistance from the U.S. Government, becoming the first policewoman in Bangladesh to receive SWAT training in the United States. ICITAP’s CWT Program is managed with the support of and in coordination with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). #> 6                                                                                                                                        On September 13, ICITAP’s Assistant Director for ICITAP Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) announced that in July of 2022, the second iteration of the United States Government Women, Peace, and Security Congressional Report was released, showcasing key milestones from participating departments in the first implementation year of the WPS strategy. ICITAP’s Engaging Multinational Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) Program showcased as key implementer in the Department of State’s advancement of women’s recruitment, retention, and professional development in the justice and security sectors. The congressional report included key metrics and status reports from Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Agency for International Development on key activities supporting the WPS strategy. In this report the CT-Funded ICITAP EMPoWER Program’s initiative to provide advanced leadership and tactical trainings for the Commander of the Kenyan All-Female SWAT Team (AFSWAT) during a week-long study tour was highlighted as a key activity in support of the first line of effort (LEO) in the WPS Strategy under the Department of State’s framework. The study tour is highlighted as an activity that supports the preparation and meaningful participation of women around the world in decision-making processes related to conflict and crises. The excerpt from the WPS Congressional Report is as follows: “CT hosted a Kenyan delegation to Washington as part of the “Engaging Multinational Policewomen [on Equality] and Rights” (EMPoWER) program, which is designed to promote the participation of women police in counterterrorism law enforcement efforts. During the week-long study tour, the commander of the Kenyan All-Female Special Weapons and Tactics (AFSWAT) Team, along with senior leadership of the Kenyan Administrative Policy, visited multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies to learn about improving recruitment, training, and mentorship of women police, and strengthening networking and mentorship opportunities.” ICITAP’s EMPoWER program builds the capacity of foreign counterterrorism law enforcement agencies and contributes to the advancement of women in leadership in the justice and security sectors. #>      changed    created

Public Information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and proceedings <\/p> <p>(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows: <\/p> <p>(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions; <\/p><p>(B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available; <\/p> <p>(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations; <\/p> <p>(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and <\/p> <p>(E) each amendment, revision or repeal of the foregoing. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof, a person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be adversely affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal Register and not so published. For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. <\/p><p>(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases[;], <em>if the final opinions or orders are cited, used, or relied on as precedent by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p>(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; and <\/p> <p>(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public; <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. To the extent required to prevent a<em>n<\/em> [clearly] unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction. However, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made available or published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency only if-- <\/p><blockquote>   <blockquote> <p>(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or <\/p> <p>(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote><p>(3)<em>(A)<\/em> Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request <em>by any United States person<\/em> for records which [(A)] <em>(i)<\/em> reasonably describes such records and [(B)] <em>(ii)<\/em> is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to [any person] <em>the requester.<\/em> <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) A requester shall not make or maintain a request under this paragraph for records relating to the subject matter of an  ongoing judicial or adjudicatory administrative proceeding (civil or criminal) to which the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in making the request, is a party <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) An agency may require by regulation that each request for records under this section include declarations by the requester that the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in  making the request, is: <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a United States person as defined in this section, and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) not barred by subsection (a) (3) (B) from making the request. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>A request that does not comply with any such regulation requirement is not a proper request under this section. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(4) (A) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying a uniform schedule of fees applicable to all constituent units of such agency. <em>The schedule may provide for the payment of all costs reasonably attributable to responding to the request, including the costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.<\/em> [Such fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication and provide for recovery of only the direct costs of such search and duplication.] <em>If the requested records contain commercially valuable technological or reference information, generated or acquired by the government at substantial cost to the public, fees may be charged which reflect the fair market value or royalties or both, in addition to or in lieu of any processing fees otherwise chargeable, taking into account such factors as the estimated commercial value of the information, its cost to the government, and any public interest served by its disclosure<\/em>. Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where the agency determines, <em>in the exercise of its discretion,<\/em> that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying  procedures by which--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a submitter may be required to designate, at the time of submission, any information consisting of trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information, which is exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4);<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency shall notify the submitter that a request has been made for information provided by the submitter within a reasonable time prior to a decision to release any such information;<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the submitter may, within 10 working day of the forwarding of such notification, submit to the agency written objection to such disclosure specifying all grounds upon which it is contended that the information should not be disclosed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the agency shall notify the submitter of any final decision to release such information.<\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(C) An agency is not required to notify a submitter pursuant to subparagraph (B) if-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) the information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with agency regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (4)(B)(i), if such designation is required by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency determines, prior to giving such notice, that the request should be denied; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the disclosure is required by law (other than this section); or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(D) If a submitter has objected pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), to disclosure of information that the agency determines to be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4), the agency shall not release such information unless the agency determines in writing that the failure to disclose the records would injure an overriding public interest and disclosure is not otherwise prohibited by law<\/em>. <\/p> <p>[(B)]<em> (E)<\/em> On complaint<em> filed by a requester within 90 days from the date of final agency action or by a submitter prior to the release of submitted information,<\/em> the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has jurisdiction--<\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i)<\/em> to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from [the complainant.] <em>the requester; or  <p>(ii) to enjoin the agency from any disclosure of records which was objected to by a submitter under subparagraph (B)(iii) or which would have been objected to had notice been given as required by subparagraph (B)(ii). <\/p><\/em> <\/p><\/blockquote> <p><em>(F) In an action based on a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) by a requester, the court shall have jurisdiction over any submitter of information <\/em> <em>contained in the requested records, and any such submitter may intervene as of right in the action; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) by a submitier, the court shall have jurisdiction over any requester of records containing information which the submitter seeks to have withheld, and any such requester may intervene as a matter of right in the action. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(G) The agency that is the subject of the complaint shall promptly, upon service of a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) seeking the production of records, notify each submitter of information contained in the requested records that the complaint was filed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) seeking the withholding of records, notify each requester of the records that the complaint was filed. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(H) In any action in which a requester is an intervenor or is joined the court shall on timely motion of the requester transfer the action to a district court which would have had jurisdiction had the action been brought by the requester, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown<\/em>. <\/p> <p><em>(I) In a case in which a record is withheld under subsection (b)(1), the court shall not enjoin the agency from withholding such record unless the agency's action is found to be arbitrary or capricious<\/em>. In [such a case] <em>all other cases<\/em>, the court shall determine the matter de novo [,]. [and] <em>The court<\/em> may examine the contents of [such] <em>requested<\/em> agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section [,].

The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies  of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employees or his representative. The  administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends. <\/p> <p>[(G)] <em>(N)<\/em> In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member in every agency proceeding. <\/p><p>(6) (A) Each agency, upon request [for records] made under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection <em>for records which are sufficiently identified and limited that no more than eight working hours of search and review time are required to respond to the request, and which do not contain trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information provided by a submitter<\/em>, shall-- <\/p><blockquote><blockquote> <p>(i) determine within ten <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; and <\/p> <p>(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>[(B) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of the subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days. As used in this subparagraph, \"unusual circumstances\" means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request-- <\/p> <blockquote> <p>(i) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; <\/p> <p>(ii) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or <\/p> <p>(iii) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.] <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (A), each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection shall-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) within thirty working days after the receipt of the request-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) determine whether to comply with such request, in whole or in part, and immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the requester's right to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed one year; and <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(ii) within thirty working days after the receipt of an appeal-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) make a determination of the appeal; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed six months. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p><em>If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the requester of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying the time periods under subparagraph (B).

to amend the Freedom of Information Act continue on Capitol Hill. <\/p> <p>Major highlights of the efforts to amend the FOIA have been the presentation of the Administration's proposal (see pp. 3-8 of <em>FOIA Update<\/em>) by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan C. Rose of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, and subsequent hearings on this proposal (S. 1751/H.R. 4805) and on a similar proposal, S. 1730, Senator Orrin G. Hatch's FOIA reform bill. Senator Hatch is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Judiciary   Committee. The Hatch subcommittee has held six hearings on the need for FOIA reform.<\/p> <p>In presenting the Administration's proposal on Oct. 15, Assistant Attorney General Rose declared that the Administration stands \"fully committed to carrying out the philosophy and spirit of the Act.\" <\/p> <p>Rose told the Hatch subcommittee that the Administration is \"concerned that in some instances the Freedom of Information Act has been used in ways that are inconsistent with the original objectives of the Congress.\" These include efforts for disclosures which have \"interfered unduly with proper law enforcement activities and national security functions,\" Rose said. He also pointed to the considerable expense involved in FOIA processing and the diversion of agency resources from program responsibilities. <\/p> <p>The Office of Legal Policy began its comprehensive review of the need for FOIA reform in May of this year by asking federal agencies to comment on problems encountered in administering the FOIA and to recommend specific changes in the law. The Administration's legislative proposal represents a synthesis of these recommendations. <\/p> <p>The Administration's proposal includes two additional exemptions to the existing nine; clarification of several existing exemptions; modifications of provisions to allow for new time limits and fee assessments; additional procedures and protections for business information; and new provisions which would preclude use of the FOIA by persons other than U.S. citizens and by parties to lawsuits who have discovery rights. <\/p> <p>Substantive amendments to the current FOIA exemptions include: <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 1<\/strong>--The standard for judicial review with respect to classified records is proposed to be the \"arbitrary or capricious\" standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 2<\/strong>--The proposal extends confidentiality to manuals and instructions to investigators, inspectors, auditors and negotiators, and also to examination material used in employment, certification or licensing. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 4<\/strong>--The Administration's bill would enlarge the protection accorded business records by providing that such records are exempt if their release \"may impair either the legitimate competitive, financial, or business interests of any person or the government's ability to obtain such information in the future.\" In addition, the bill provides procedures by which submitters of such information may have input into agency disclosure determinations. Finally, courts deciding \"reverse FOIA\" cases would review agency disclosure decisions according to a <em>de novo<\/em> standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 6<\/strong>--The Administration's bill extends personal privacy protection to \"records or information concerning individuals\"; changes the balancing standard from a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" to an \"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\"; and exempts compilations of names and addresses that could be used for solicitation purposes. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 7<\/strong>--The Administration's bill makes the following changes: broadening of the exemption's threshold language; addition of language to ensure that investigatory information related to ongoing investigations is fully protected; protection of information that would \"tend to\" disclose the identity of a confidential source; and modification of existing language to further protect confidential sources. <\/p> <p>The bill would also provide an exemption for material related to investigations of terrorism, organized crime or foreign counterintelligence, where designated by the Attorney General. <\/p> <p>Two additional exemptions would allow agencies to protect records generated in settlement of a legal action and technical data which may not be exported outside of the United States without agency approval. <\/p> <p>The bill also provides for two new standards for assessing fees. The first one authorizes fees for the full costs attributable to the processing of requested records. The second permits assessments which reflect the true value of valuable technological or reference information. <\/p> <p>On the problem of time limits, the administration proposal would retain the 10-day time limits for material which can be processed without complication in eight working hours or less. Agencies could take up to a year to respond to more complex or voluminous requests and requests where the interests of a submitter are involved, but would have to provide a specific time estimate and explanation within 10 working days of receipt. <\/p> <p>The Administration bill also addresses the problem of the use of FOIA for discovery purposes by prohibiting a party to a judicial or administrative proceeding from filing a FOIA request for records relating to he subject matter of the proceeding. <\/p> <p>Consideration of the Administration's package and of S. 1730 continued in the Senate Subcommittee on he Constitution during November.<\/p> <p>Rep. Glenn English, chairman of he House Subcommittee on Government Information and Individual Rights, also has held hearings on the Freedom of Information Act and has indicated that he will consider further hearings and markup of a bill after the Senate takes action. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #> 4

            <strong>FOIA Update <br />Vol. III, No. 1 <br />1981<\/strong>    <h2>Recordkeeping Procedures Examined<\/h2>  <p>With few exceptions, records in the physical possession of a federal agency are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. <\/p> <p>Agencies do not, however, have to retain indefinitely all records which are created by or submitted to them. Under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3102 and § 3103, agencies are required to establish records management programs which identify records that should be preserved and to plan for the storage and disposal of records having only temporary significance. <\/p> <p>It is estimated that only about five percent of government records, because of their administrative, legal, research or other value, become part of the permanent national collection. For a variety of reasons, many more records are retained for longer periods of time than are required. <\/p> <p>In addition, some materials can be returned to submitters in the private sector, because of the circumstances under which they were obtained, once there is no longer a need for them. Agencies should be aware that once a Freedom of Information Act request has been received, the requested records assume a special status and ordinarily must be retained until the requester's access rights are determined. <\/p> <p>Federal records, generally speaking, fall into two categories: administrative materials which are standard throughout the entire government and for which there is a schedule for retention and disposition furnished by the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), and other materials which are related to the kinds of programs conducted by the individual agencies. Individual schedules for retention and final disposition of records are developed by agency personnel in consultation with the Archivist of the United States. <\/p>    <strong>The Justice Effort <\/strong>  <p>At the Justice Department, there is a full scale effort underway to help managers and clerical workers focus on files maintenance and records disposition practices. Under the guidance of Bernie Berglind of the Justice Management Division's Records and Publications Staff, a course in files maintenance and records disposition will be given five times in 1982, beginning with a class Jan. 5-6. <\/p> <p>In the course, Berglind points out that almost every move made in government generates paperwork. Some of this material--for example, reading files, informational copies and acknowledgments--need not be kept. Other routine material need not be kept for as long as some offices may keep it. In fact, a significant portion is covered by the routine retention and disposal schedule. <\/p>    <strong>At the FAA <\/strong>  <p>Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reviewed a great deal of material in the complex process of certifying the airworthiness of airplanes and the safety of parts and modifications. <\/p> <p>At first, the FAA took the position that this material -- called Type Design    Data -- was the sort of \"agency records\" required to be retained.    Although this information was generally thought to be in large part protected    under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, it was often sought by tort litigants involved    in suits against both large and small manufacturers. \"A classic use of    the FOIA in place of discovery,\" notes John Walsh, chief of the General    Law Branch, FAA. <\/p> <p>Then came two Supreme Court decisions clarifying what constitutes an \"agency record\" under the FOIA. \"Two recent Supreme Court decisions establish that the Government has no obligation, and perhaps no right, to consider manufacturers' technical data not in its possession to be agency records covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.<em> Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press<\/em>, 445 U.S. 136 (1980); <em>Forsham v. Harris<\/em>, 445 U.S. 169 (1980),\" Walsh noted in a memo. <\/p> <p>He then concluded that technical data which \"never physically reaches FAA premises because it is examined by designees of the Administrator is not 'obtained' by the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA.\" <\/p> <p>Further, \"technical data which has been returned by the FAA to the manufacturer before a FOIA request for it is received, because the FAA has no current need for it, is not in the possession or control of the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA . . .\"<\/p> <p>The FAA's new policy includes an agreement with the manufacturers that secures the records should a court disagree with agency policy or should there be some question as to the business future of a manufacturer. <\/p>    <strong>The Antitrust Division <\/strong>  <p>The Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission follow similar procedures related to return of materials. <\/p> <p>At the Antitrust Division, there is a long-standing practice of returning documents submitted in response to a grand jury subpoena or a civil investigative demand, once the investigation is completed. Rules for limiting the retention of these documents are spelled out in a Division Directive dated Dec. 18, 1980. <\/p> <p>For case law authorizing the practice of returning subpoenaed documents see <em>Application of Bendix Aviation Corp.<\/em>, 58 F. Supp. 953 (S.D.N.Y. 1945), and <em>In re Petroleum Industry Investigation<\/em>, 152 F. Supp. 646 (E.D. Va. 1957). <\/p> <p>At the FTC, Jack Schwartz, deputy assistant general counsel, said that the 96th Congress, apparently noting that DOJ's practices seemed to be working, \"in essence required the FTC to adopt a formal practice\" of returning original documents to submitters. The FTC would keep copies, only as needed, Schwartz says. The FTC regulation, adopted in accord with P.L. 96-252, states that \"[A]ny person who has submitted documentary material to the Commission may file a written request for the return of original documents which have not been received into evidence (1) after the close of the proceeding in connection with which the documents were submitted, or (2) when no proceeding in which the material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time . . .\"<\/p> <p>In sum, the timely application of destruction schedules and other record disposition techniques can result in superior records management and less costly FOIA searches.

<br /><\/p><p> <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Worthington Compressors, Inc., et al. v. Costle<\/em>, Nos. 80-1010, 80-1011, 80-1012, 80-1013 (D.C. Cir., Aug. 20, 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in this case expanded the availability of FOIA Exemption 4 by identifying a new factor to be considered when determining if submitted business material is confidential. <\/p> <p>Four manufacturers of portable air compressors who submitted reports on their    products to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were the appellants in    this case. They requested confidential treatment for their information, but    the agency rejected their objections to disclosure on the grounds that the information    could be duplicated by anyone with access to the air compressors through \"reverse    engineering.\" The manufacturers then sought to enjoin release in the district    court. They contended that the information constituted confidential commercial    information and should be withheld under Exemption 4. Further, they alleged    that the reverse engineering which could be undertaken to determine the design    and engineering specifications of their compressors would be so expensive as    to be commercially impracticable. The district court below sustained the agency    and ordered disclosure. <\/p> <p>The court of appeals, however, reversed. In determining whether information    is confidential in Exemption 4 cases, the circuit court said it is proper to    determine \"whether release of the requested information, given its commercial    value to competitors and the cost of acquiring it through other means, will    cause substantial competitive harm to the business that submitted it.\"    Accordingly, the court concluded, consideration should be given to how costly    it would be for a possible competitor to obtain the information through means    other than the FOIA and whether FOIA disclosure would constitute a windfall    to the requester. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Bast v. U.S. Department of Justice<\/em>, Nos. 79-2039, 80-1050    (D.C. Cir., Sept. 10, 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>This case grew out of a hearing in a previous case. Richard Bast, a private    investigator, alleged that U.S. District Judge John Pratt improperly induced    a court reporter to expunge a portion of a hearing transcript in the earlier    case. Bast then requested access to all FBI documents compiled during the investigation    into the allegation. After the FBI released approximately 600 pages of such    documents, Bast brought suit challenging all withholdings. With a few exceptions,    the district court agreed that the remaining documents were exempt from disclosure.  <\/p> <p>On appeal, 12 documents remained at issue. The agency asserted that all of    the withheld material fell within Exemption 7(C) -- the investigatory records    exemption relating to personal privacy. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said    that while Exemption 7(C) affords broad privacy rights to \"suspects, witnesses    and investigators,\" there still must be a case-by-case balancing of privacy    rights against the public interest in disclosure. <\/p> <p>After reviewing the documents <em>in camera<\/em> the court decided that, with    one exception, the privacy interest outweighed the public interest. The unique    exception is a three sentence passage containing comments by the judge which    the circuit court found could be interpreted as revealing a bias. \"The    public importance of judicial impartiality outweighs the privacy interest in    this case,\" the court ruled in ordering disclosure of that passage. A petition    for rehearing has been filed by the Department of Justice. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p><strong><em>Brown v. Federal Bureau of Investigation<\/em>, 658 F.2d 71 (2d    Cir. 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>In this case, a convicted kidnapper sought access to detailed information from    FBI files regarding his kidnaping victim. He argued that the victim had waived    her privacy rights by testifying at his trial and that, in any event, he had    an overriding need for the information in order to attack his conviction. The    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the requested information    was properly withheld under Exemption 6 and rejected the plaintiffs arguments.    After finding the requested information to be sufficiently personal to satisfy    the \"similar files\" threshold of Exemption 6, the court of appeals    held that the victim's testimony at the trial did not constitute a waiver of    \"her right to keep private other related matters.\" Most significantly,    the court of appeals found the plaintiff's stated interest in using such information    to obtain a new trial to be \"too uncertain, indirect, and remote\"    to overcome the victim's privacy interests in nondisclosure. (A somewhat contrary    outcome on this latter point was reached by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals    in<em> Ferri v. Bell<\/em>, published at 645 F.2d 1213, earlier this year, but    that decision was vacated on Oct. 23 by the Third Circuit and scheduled for    reargument.) <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <em><\/em>   <strong><em>Radovich v. United States Attorney, District of Maryland<\/em>,    658 F.2d 957 (4th Cir. 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>\"Confidential\" as used in the first clause of Exemption 7(D) does    not mean \"secret;\" rather, it means \"given in confidence\"    or \"in trust,\" the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit made clear    in this case. <\/p> <p>The court below had found that the information sought by the plaintiff in this    case was not protected because it was publicly known that the source had spoken    with government prosecutors. Accordingly, said the district court, the identity    of the source -- an attorney for an individual involved in the criminal investigation    -- was \"neither confidential nor at issue.\" In overruling the district    court, the circuit court of appeals concluded that the first clause of Exemption    7(D) serves to protect the attorney's conversations so long as the information    was given under an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances    where such an assurance could reasonably be assumed. Public knowledge of the    source's identity is irrelevant, the appellate court found. <\/p> <p>The Fourth Circuit also examined the second clause of Exemption 7(D), which    the district court has found likewise inapplicable, and construed it broadly    as well. The circuit court found that Congress intended to protect all of the    information furnished by a confidential source \"in the course of a criminal    investigation, irrespective of whether the information might have been available    from some other source.\" <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #>      changed    created       date teaser #> 1 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 2 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 3 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 4 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 5 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 6 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #>                                                                                            title #> 1 FOIA Update: Text of Freedom of Information Act, Showing Changes Proposed in S. 1751/H.R. 4805 #> 2                                                    FOIA Update: OILP Publishes 1981  Case List #> 3                                                              FOIA Update: FOIA Reform Proposed #> 4                                                       FOIA Update: FOIA Training Opportunities #> 5                                                 FOIA Update: Recordkeeping Procedures Examined #> 6                                                         FOIA Update: Significant New Decisions #>                                                                                                                url #> 1 https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-text-freedom-information-act-showing-changes-proposed-s-1751hr-4805 #> 2                                       https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-oilp-publishes-1981-case-list #> 3                                                https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-reform-proposed #> 4                                      https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-training-opportunities-62 #> 5                                   https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-recordkeeping-procedures-examined #> 6                                        https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-significant-new-decisions-55 #>                                   uuid                                vuuid #> 1 4c7090d2-3e8f-4cc7-8160-2e15a2814090 b5d3e433-c9d2-4e4f-acb2-c2e722852530 #> 2 860458cd-687f-4f47-b844-1cc27d90b430 82035722-4d22-44dc-86b9-3f8c981d2f40 #> 3 bb7edcc0-9bec-4215-a7f7-0120caf14238 db71aa8b-924b-461a-a544-ba5bc1844fb3 #> 4 e2d43e0d-99db-49fb-8ac9-87fa0e526e8d 8ed9c40a-ed7d-4463-affb-7c03f100037a #> 5 e7024fa1-22a1-49f0-80ae-5e563fcd94b3 cd549f68-a8b5-4d3a-9846-928bd48300db #> 6 cee7fff5-c6e2-405e-b047-1b318edfe166 2a4fb4f5-fadd-4ddb-8678-2b2fddb43126 #>                           name #> 1 Office of Information Policy #> 2 Office of Information Policy #> 3 Office of Information Policy #> 4 Office of Information Policy #> 5 Office of Information Policy #> 6 Office of Information Policy"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"accessing U.S. Department Justice (DOJ) open data press releases.","code":""},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"","code":"doj_press_releases(     n_results = 50,     search_direction = \"DESC\",     keyword = NULL,     clean = TRUE   )"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"n_results number results return. default, 50 results returned. search_direction Set ASC DESC fetch data starting least recent entries. default, data sorted descending order (recent entries). keyword return results containing keyword.

Missouri, and their professional companies, Midwest Neurosurgeons, LLC and DS Medical, LLC, have agreed to pay $825,000 to resolve a lawsuit alleging that they violated the False Claims Act by soliciting and receiving kickbacks from spinal implant companies.The Justice Department’s lawsuit alleged that Dr. Fonn, Ms. Seeger, Midwest Neurosurgeons, and DS Medical solicited and received remuneration from spinal implant companies in return for arranging for the use of those companies’ products in Dr. Fonn’s surgeries, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits soliciting or receiving anything of value in return for the referral of items or services covered by federal health care programs. The statute is intended to ensure that medical providers’ judgments are not compromised by improper financial incentives.“The Anti-Kickback Statute plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity of medical care provided to federal health care program beneficiaries,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Treatment decisions should be determined by beneficiaries’ medical needs, not by kickbacks provided to their surgeon.”“This case took nearly a decade of hard work by my office, the whistleblowers, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, the FBI and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office,” said U.S. Attorney Sayler A. Fleming for the Eastern District of Missouri. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will always vigorously pursue anyone who fraudulently obtains taxpayer money and defrauds Medicare and Medicaid.”“Medical providers who accept kickbacks put personal financial gain before the needs of their patients. This behavior can harm patients and undermines the integrity of federal health care programs,” said acting Special Agent in Charge Linda Hanley of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG is proud to work alongside our federal and state partners to protect our programs from fraud and ensure that patient needs drive provider decisions.”The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Paul Cairns, Dr. Terry Cleaver, Dr. Kyle Colle, Dr. Scott Gibbs, Dr. Paul Tolentino, Dr. Kevin Vaught, and Daniel Henson. Under those provisions, a private party can file an action on behalf of the United States and receive a portion of any recovery. The share to be paid to the private parties has not yet been determined in this matter.The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, with assistance from the FBI, the HHS-OIG, and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Missouri Attorney General’s Office.The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.

Bates sentenced Alex Ogando to 12 years.  Olatunji Dawodu and Luis Spencer were previously sentenced to 12 years and 12 ½ years, respectively.  All three defendants were convicted of conspiracy to distribute 400 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing fentanyl.             The Darknet operations pumped kilograms of fentanyl pills into communities across the nation over the course of four years, using Darknet markets including AlphaBay, Dream, Wall Street, and Empire to reach a broad customer base.  The defendants also used encrypted messaging services to communicate with and sell pills directly to customers.  In exchange for cryptocurrency, the defendants sold fentanyl pills that were shipped via the U.S. Postal Service to buyers in the District of Columbia and all 50 states.  The conspiracies relied on sophisticated technology to distribute and profit from a staggering quantity of pills pressed with fentanyl.            The case was prosecuted by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Crane and Assistant U.S. Attorney Connor Mullin.  The investigation was conducted by the FBI’s Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force, which is composed of FBI agents, analysts, and task force partners, including special agents and officers of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, DEA, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and detectives from local assisting police agencies. Additional assistance was provided by the United States Attorney’s Offices for the District of Rhode Island and the Southern District of Florida, the FBI’s Miami and Boston Field Offices, and the IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that AMIT BHARDWAJ, the former Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) at Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“Lumentum”), pled guilty to 13 counts arising from his participation in a scheme to commit insider trading based on material, non-public information (“MNPI”) that BHARDWAJ misappropriated from his employer, Lumentum.  BHARDWAJ traded on the misappropriated MNPI himself and tipped his associates with this same information so that they could place profitable trades in Lumentum’s acquisition targets. BHARDWAJ was arrested and charged in July 2022 and pled guilty earlier today before U.S. District Judge Gregory H. Woods.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Amit Bhardwaj, the former Chief Information Security Officer of Lumentum, ironically failed to keep the confidential information he was trusted with secure as he shared it with numerous friends and a family member in order to make a profit.  Not only did Bhardwaj betray his company and cheat the securities markets, but when confronted by the FBI, he also schemed to conceal his illicit behavior and obstruct the investigation.  Today’s guilty plea emphasizes this Office’s commitment to protecting the integrity of the financial markets.”According to the allegations in the Indictment and statements made in public court proceedings:In approximately December 2020, BHARDWAJ learned that Lumentum was considering acquiring Coherent, Inc (“Coherent”).  Based on this information, BHARDWAJ himself purchased Coherent stock and call options, and BHARDWAJ tipped three associates –– his friend Dhirenkumar Patel, another friend, and one of BHARDWAJ’s close family relatives ––and these individuals all traded in Coherent securities as a result.  BHARDWAJ and Patel agreed that Patel would pay BHARDWAJ 50% of the profits that Patel earned by trading in Coherent based on the MNPI provided by BHARDWAJ.  When Coherent’s stock price increased substantially following the announcement of the Lumentum acquisition, BHARDWAJ, his close family member, his friend Patel, and another friend closed their positions in Coherent securities and collectively profited by nearly $900,000.In or about October 2021, BHARDWAJ learned that Lumentum was engaged in confidential discussions with Neophotonics Corporation (“Neophotonics”) about a potential acquisition.  BHARDWAJ provided this information to SRINIVASA KAKKERA, ABBAS SAEEDI, and Ramesh Chitor, and these individuals all traded in Neophotonics securities as a result.  In connection with Chitor’s trading, BHARDWAJ and Chitor agreed that Chitor and BHARDWAJ would split the profits equally.  When Neophotonics’ stock price increased substantially following the announcement of the Lumentum acquisition in November 2021, KAKKERA, SAEEDI, and Chitor closed their positions in Neophotonics securities and made collectively approximately $4.3 million in realized and unrealized profits.After they were interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) voluntarily and served with federal grand jury subpoenas on approximately March 29, 2022, BHARDWAJ took steps to obstruct the federal investigation of their conduct.  On the day of the March 29, 2022, FBI interviews, BHARDWAJ drove to the homes of certain of his co-conspirators to encourage them not to tell the federal authorities the truth about their insider trading scheme.  BHARDWAJ and his associates subsequently met in person on multiple occasions and discussed, among other things, potential false stories that would conceal their insider trading scheme as well as creating false documents to buttress lies regarding payments that were, in reality, related to the insider trading scheme.*                *                *BHARDWAJ, 49, of San Ramon, California, pled guilty to seven counts of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison, and four counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum term of five years in prison. The statutory maximum sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.  BHARDWAJ is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Woods on July 11, 2023, at 10 a.m.Mr. Williams praised the investigative work of the FBI.  He also acknowledged the assistance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which separately initiated civil proceedings against BHARDWAJ.This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Noah Solowiejczyk and Adam Hobson are in charge of the prosecution. #> 4

conspiring to distribute fentanyl, United States Attorney Jane E. Young announced today.            According to court documents and statements made in court, Canario-Batista was part of a drug-distribution conspiracy operating in Lawrence, Massachusetts that distributed fentanyl into New Hampshire. The defendant provided a stash house for fentanyl imported from an international source of supply and assisted in distributing the fentanyl to other larger distributors.  The defendant was intercepted on a court authorized wiretap arranging drug purchases from a co-conspirator who was importing the drugs. The interceptions and other evidence resulted in the execution of a search warrant at the defendant’s residence which resulted in the seizure of over 7 kilograms of fentanyl.            “This is another example of the many people needed to make an international drug conspiracy function” said U.S. Attorney Young.  “The defendant operated a critical way station as the dangerous fentanyl traveled from its international source to the New Hampshire streets. We will continue to investigate and prosecute those involved at every level of moving this dangerous drug.”            “DEA is committed to investigating and dismantling Drug Trafficking Organizations and individuals like Mr. Batista who are responsible for distributing lethal drugs like fentanyl to the citizens of New Hampshire,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Brian D. Boyle.  “Today’s substantial sentence not only holds Mr. Batista accountable for his crimes but serves as a warning to those traffickers who are fueling the opioid epidemic with deadly drugs in order to profit and destroy people’s lives.  DEA’s top priority is combatting the opioid epidemic by working with our local, county, state and federal partners to bring to justice anyone who distributes this poison.”            “Canario-Batista played an important role in the supply chain that brings deadly opiates like fentanyl into our communities. International drug trafficking is an incredibly complex problem that can only be addressed through collaboration and we are proud to join our partners with the Drug Enforcement Administration as we work together for results like today’s sentence,” said Michael Krol, Acting Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England.            This matter was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Seth Aframe, John Kennedy and Heather Cherniske.### #> 5 A former prison warden was sentenced today in the Northern District of California to 70 months in prison, 15 years of supervised release and $15,000 in restitution for sexually abusive conduct against three female victims who were serving prison sentences and one count of making false statements to government agents.Ray J. Garcia, 55, of Merced, California, was sentenced following his conviction by a federal jury in December 2022. Trial evidence showed that Garcia was employed as an associate warden and later as the warden of the Federal Correctional Institute in Dublin, California (FCI Dublin), an all-female low security federal correctional institution. All three of Garcia’s victims were incarcerated and serving their prison sentences at FCI Dublin under the custodial, supervisory and disciplinary authority of Garcia when the crimes occurred.“The defendant in this case abused his authority as a warden and violated his oath to protect those in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “The sentence he received today is another step forward in our ongoing efforts to root out sexual misconduct within the BOP. This prosecution should serve as both warning and reassurance that the Department of Justice will not waver in holding accountable BOP employees and executives who abuse their authority — whether they be a correctional officer, chaplain, or warden — and in pursuing justice for their victims.”“Rather than ensuring that female inmates at the Dublin prison were safe and secure, Garcia used his position as warden to sexually abuse three inmates over multiple years, intimidated inmates and lied to cover up his crimes, and created a heinous culture that failed to protect female inmates from widespread sexual abuse and violence at the hands of other Dublin employees. The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General will continue to aggressively investigate this type of egregious criminal conduct and we will do everything within our authority to bring perpetrators to justice,” said Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz.“Corrections officials are sworn to protect people and preserve civil rights — the extreme opposite of this defendant's heinous actions,” said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. “Garcia assaulted and harmed those in his care and custody, attempted to intimidate them into silence, and then lied in an effort to cover up his crimes. The FBI is grateful to the brave women who came forward to report these vile offenses, and we hope today’s sentence is one more step towards justice and healing.”“The evidence in this case paints a disturbing picture of a former warden who abused the trust placed in him, as well as authority granted to him, all while thinking he could get away with his crimes by lying to investigators and intimidating his victims,” said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. “Today’s sentence demonstrates that prison walls present no impediment to justice. The Department of Justice will hold accountable any prison official who violates their duty to protect those in federal custody.”The trial evidence established that Garcia abused inmates from December 2019 until July 2021. Garcia’s sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact against Victim 1 began in December 2019 and extended through March 2020, the abuse of Victim 2 occurred January to July 2021 and the abuse of Victim 3 occurred during the period of March to September 2020. The jury convicted Garcia of three counts sexual abuse and one count of sexually abusive contact as to Victim 1, two counts of abusive sexual contact as to Victim 2, and one count of abusive sexual contact as to Victim 3.The government’s sentencing memorandum described how Garcia also sought to deter his victims from coming forward. For example, Garcia told his victims he was friends with the person in charge of investigating sexual abuse of inmates, boasted that he could “never be fired,” and warned them that he worked for “Washington, D.C.” Garcia also instructed a victim to “get rid of any evidence” and reported falsely to another victim that a different inmate was sent back to FCI Dublin after pictures of a correctional officer were found on her phone. According to the government’s memorandum, Garcia created and perpetuated a culture of abuse. The government also pointed out that four other correctional officers at FCI Dublin have been charged with sexually abusing inmates while Garcia was associate warden or warden. The trial evidence also demonstrated Garcia made false statements to federal investigators. On July 22, 2021, Garcia was interviewed and told investigators he never asked inmates to be undressed for him and that he had never touched an inmate inappropriately. Trial evidence showed that Garcia had already asked multiple inmates to undress for him and had also touched Victim 1, Victim 2 and Victim 3 in a sexual manner.Garcia was initially charged with sexual abuse of an inmate on Sept. 24, 2021. A federal grand jury issued a superseding indictment on Aug. 23, 2022, charging Garcia with three counts of sexual abuse and four counts of abusive sexual contact against three female inmates. The superseding indictment also charged Garcia with one count of making false statements to a government agency during the investigation of the criminal acts. On Dec. 8, 2022, a jury convicted Garcia of all counts.Judge Gonzalez Rogers ordered Garcia to report to surrender on or before May 19 to begin serving his prison term.The Justice Department Office of Inspector General and the FBI are investigating the case, with the cooperation of the Bureau of Prisons.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Molly Priedeman and Andrew Paulson for the Northern District of California, with the assistance of Madeline Wachs, Leeya Kekona and Sara Slattery are prosecuting the case. #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, held on March 20 that Jeffrey Cadet violated a permanent injunction entered against him on Aug. 12, 2019, which barred him from acting as a federal tax return preparer or requesting, assisting in, or directing the preparation or filing of federal tax returns for others.On Jan. 5, 2022, following an investigation of Cadet’s activities, the United States filed a Motion for Order to Show Cause asking the court to hold Cadet in civil contempt based on evidence that he was preparing tax returns without signing them as the return preparer. The investigation was undertaken by the Tax Division as part of its effort to monitor the conduct of return preparers who have been enjoined from preparing returns for others, and to hold accountable those who violate their injunction.As the court noted, Cadet did not respond to the motion or contest the evidence against him. Based on the evidence presented by the United States, the court found that Cadet violated his injunction by continuing to prepare returns for customers and held him in civil contempt. To remedy his contempt, the court ordered Cadet to disgorge $24,410 in ill-gotten fees he received for conduct that violated the injunction. The court also ordered Cadet to pay the United States $7,386.39 to reimburse the government for the attorneys’ fees it incurred to investigate and prosecute his post-injunction conduct. The injunction barring Cadet from preparing tax returns remains in effect, and the United States remains authorized to monitor his compliance with the court’s orders.Deputy Assistant Attorney General David A. Hubbert of the Justice Department’s Tax Division made the announcement.Taxpayers seeking a return preparer should remain vigilant against unscrupulous tax preparers, including “ghost preparers” who don’t sign the returns they prepare. The IRS has information on its website for choosing a tax return preparer and has launched a free directory of federal tax preparers.

<p>  WASHINGTON   – A federal jury in Jacksonville, Fla., found Paul Tillis, a former Florida Department of Corrections officer, guilty on Jan. 16, 2009, of a felony federal civil rights violation for an August 2005 assault on an inmate.<\/p>    <p>  The evidence at trial showed that on Aug. 14, 2005, Tillis assaulted the victim by pouring a bottle of scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis was on duty as a supervisory corrections officer at the  Florida State Prison in Raiford. During his shift, one of the inmates in his custody allegedly feigned injury by lying on the floor of his cell. In response, the defendant filled a bottle from a nearby dispenser that provided water at near-boiling temperatures, then poured the scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis also failed to arrange for medical treatment for the victim, who suffered second degree burns on his chest as a result of this assault.<\/p>    <p>  \"It is important that corrections officers realize they may not use their positions of authority to inflict physical harm on inmates as punishment,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King for the Civil Rights Division. \"While the vast majority of law enforcement officers carry out their difficult duties in a lawful and professional manner, the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute those who cross the line and commit this type of unlawful act.\"<\/p>    <p>  Tillis faces a maximum punishment of ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez announced.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font pleaded guilty to devising and engaging in a scheme that deprived the people of Puerto Rico of his honest services as a legislator, performed free from conflict of interest, concealment and improper influence. De Castro Font also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion through fear of economic harm and under color of official right. De Castro Font was indicted for these and other related offenses on Oct. 2, 2008.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Francisco Augusto Besosa in the District of Puerto Rico. De Castro Font admitted that from Jan. 2, 2005, through August 2008, he directly and indirectly solicited between approximately $500,000 and $525,000 in cash payments and other benefits, such as campaign contributions in excess of the legal limits, lodging, private flights, meals and other things of value, from individuals. De Castro Font admitted that he engaged in official acts on behalf of some of these individuals who had provided him with these undisclosed benefits, including but not limited to, proposing legislation, preventing legislative projects to be voted or acted upon, and persuading other legislators to vote for or against legislation.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font also admitted to participating in a conspiracy to obtain cash and other benefits from five individuals whom he admitted he knew felt that if they did not provide him with the financial benefits requested, De Castro Font could use his official position to harm their financial interests.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Judge Besosa scheduled a sentencing hearing on Apr. 23, 2009.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Using an elected office for personal gain denies citizens the honest services of their elected leaders,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin. \"The Department will continue to identify and prosecute public officials who corruptly use their position and influence to illegally benefit themselves.\"<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Senator De Castro Font has accepted responsibility for the acts of public corruption charged in the indictment. His conduct was an affront to the voters of Puerto Rico who placed their trust and confidence in him and the institution that he represented, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. His blatant disregard for his oath of office and his breach of the public trust, for his personal enrichment, violated the very essence of our democratic government. We will continue our public corruption investigations against public officials and those who make illegal payments in exchange for official acts,\" said U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Let this conviction send a stark message to all public servants that the sale of influence and public corruption will not be tolerated by the FBI or the law-abiding citizens of Puerto Rico,\" said Luis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI-San Juan Field Office.  \"The FBI will continue to be vigilant so as to root out all public corruption.  As I have said before, corruption affects every facet of society: the people, honest businessmen, education and public works.\"<\/p>\\n\\n<p>On Dec. 4, 2008, Alberto Goachet, a political consultant and aide to De Castro Font, pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to launder illegal campaign contributions and other payments.  Goachet admitted that he and others laundered the money through the use of fake invoices purporting to reflect legitimate payments to a political consulting firm owned by Goachet. Goachet admitted that the false invoices were meant to conceal a businessman’s illegal payments to De Castro Font. Goachet also admitted that in August 2008 he falsely claimed in an interview with the FBI that the invoices were legitimately written for services rendered to the businessman and denied that the money was intended for De Castro Font.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacqueline Novas and Timothy R. Henwood of the District of Puerto Rico, and Trial Attorney Matthew L. Stennes of the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section.

Breuer de la División de lo Penal; el Fiscal Federal Wifredo A. Ferrer del Distrito Sur de Florida; y Daniel W. Auer, Agente Especial a Cargo del Servicio de Impuestos Internos, Oficina Local de Miami de Investigaciones Penales (IRS-CI).<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Antonio Perez, 52, de Miami, también fue condenado por el Juez Federal de Distrito Jose E. Martinez a dos años de libertad bajo supervisión después de haber cumplido su sentencia en prisión, y a entregar $36,375 al gobierno. Perez se declaró culpable el 27 de abril de 2009, de conspirar para realizar pagos corruptos para una compañía de telecomunicaciones del Condado de Miami-Dade a funcionarios de la compañía de telecomunicaciones estatal de la República de Haití, Telecommunications D'Haiti, en violación de la Ley de Prácticas Corruptas en el Extranjero (FCPA) y leyes de lavado de dinero.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>En su declaración de culpabilidad, Perez admitió haber conspirado para realizar pagos corruptos a funcionarios gubernamentales extranjeros con la finalidad de obtener ventajas comerciales para la empresa de telecomunicaciones por parte de Telecommunications D'Haiti. De acuerdo con el expediente judicial, Perez conspiró con Robert Antoine, el ex director de relaciones internacionales para Telecommunications D'Haiti y Juan Diaz, el propietario de J.D. Locator Services, junto con otros. Perez y sus coconspiradores ocultaros los pagos de sobornos en parte al conducir transacciones financieras en las que se realizaron transferencias telegráficas de dinero a empresas fantasma y a través de denominaciones falsas en facturas, cheques y libros contables. Perez admitió que él mismo estuvo involucrado en dos pagos de sobornos por un total de aproximadamente 36,375 dólares.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>El 30 de julio de 2010, Diaz fue sentenciado a 57 meses en prisión después de haberse declarado culpable de pagar y ocultar 1,028,851 dólares en sobornos a ex funcionarios del gobierno de Haití mientras actuaba como intermediario para tres empresas privadas de telecomunicaciones. Antoine admitió que aceptó los sobornos, incluidos sobornos de Diaz, y se declaró culpable el 12 de marzo de 2010 a conspiración para cometer lavado de dinero. Antoine fue sentenciado a cuatro años en prisión.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Joel Esquenazi y Carlos Rodriguez, los propietarios de la empresa de telecomunicaciones en la que trabajaba Perez, así como Jean Rene Duperval, quien fue director de relaciones internacionales de Telecommunications D´'Haiti de junio de 2003 a abril de 2004, y la hermana de Duperval, Marguerite Grandison, fueron acusados formalmente junto con Antoine, el 4 de diciembre de 2009. El enjuiciamiento de los demás demandados tiene su inicio programado para el 28 de febrero de 2011 en el Tribunal Federal de Distrito en Miami. Una acusación formal es apenas una acusación, y se supone que los demandados son inocentes hasta que se pruebe lo contrario más allá de la duda razonable.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>El Departamento de Justicia agradece al gobierno de Haití por su importante asistencia en recabar pruebas durante esta investigación. En particular, la unidad de inteligencia financiera de Haiti, la Unite Centrale de Renseignements Financiers, el Bureau des Affaires Financieres et Economiques, el cual es un componente especializado de la Policía Nacional Haitiana, y el Ministerio de Justicia y Seguridad Pública brindar importante cooperación y coordinación en la investigación.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Están a cargo de la acusación en el caso la Fiscal Federal Auxiliar Aurora Fagan de la Fiscalía Federal para el Distrito Sur de Florida, la Abogada Litigante Sénior Nicola J.

EL AL, an Israeli company, has agreed to pay a criminal fine of $15.7 million.<\/p>    <p>  Including today’s charges, a total of 12 airlines and three executives have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in the Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into price fixing in the air transportation industry. To date, more than $1 billion in criminal fines have been imposed and executives have been sentenced to serve a total of 20 months in jail.<\/p>    <p>  According to the charges filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, each airline engaged in a conspiracy in the United States and elsewhere to eliminate competition by fixing the cargo rates charged to customers for international air shipments, including to and from the United States. LAN Cargo and ABSA are charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about February 2003 and continuing until at least Feb. 14, 2006. EL AL is charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about January 2003 until at least Feb. 14, 2006. The plea agreements are subject to court approval. Each airline has agreed to cooperate with the Department’s ongoing investigation.<\/p>    <p>  \"American consumers were forced to pay higher prices on the goods they buy every day as a result of the inflated and collusive shipping rates charged by these companies,\" said Scott D. Hammond, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Antitrust Division.<\/p>    <p>  LAN Cargo, ABSA and EL AL are charged with carrying out the price-fixing conspiracy with co-conspirators by:<\/p>  <ul><li>Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere to discuss the cargo rates to be charged on certain routes to and from the United States;<\/li>  <li>Agreeing, during those meetings, conversations and communications on certain components of the cargo rates to charge for shipments on certain routes to and from the United States; <\/li>  <li>Levying cargo rates in the United States and elsewhere in accordance with the agreements reached; and<\/li>  <li>Engaging in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon cargo rates.<\/li>  <\/ul><p>  The nine airlines that have pleaded guilty to date as a result of the Department’s ongoing investigation into the air transportation industry are: British Airways Plc (British Airways), Korean Air Lines Ltd., Qantas Airways Limited (Qantas), Japan Airlines International Co.

Grant, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office announced.<\/p>    <p>  William Cozzi, 51, pleaded guilty to a one-count information in U.S. District Court in Chicago, admitting he used excessive or unreasonable force while acting under color of law. Cozzi joined the Chicago Police Department in 1992 and was assigned to the 25<sup>th<\/sup> District at the time of the alleged incident. He was subsequently suspended from duty. Cozzi was indicted in April 2008 for depriving the victim of his civil rights.<\/p>    <p>  On Aug. 2, 2005, while performing his duties as a police officer, Cozzi admitted that he used a \"sap,\" a dangerous weapon similar to a blackjack, to repeatedly strike the victim who was handcuffed and shackled in a wheelchair at Norwegian American Hospital, resulting in bodily injury. At the time, the victim was awaiting treatment in the hospital emergency room after being stabbed in the shoulder.<\/p>    <p>  \"The defendant violated the public trust by abusing his law enforcement authority,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King.  \"This prosecution demonstrates that the Civil Rights Division is committed to aggressively prosecuting law enforcement officers who willfully use excessive force.\"<\/p>    <p>  \"No law enforcement officer may use unreasonable force with impunity and every citizen, regardless of being in police custody, has a constitutional right to be free from the use of excessive force,\" U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald said.<\/p>    <p>  Cozzi pleaded guilty while reserving his right to appeal a ruling last year denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the prosecution was based in part on compelled statements he made to the Chicago Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards and during a police review board hearing.<\/p>    <p>  According to a plea agreement, Cozzi was dispatched to the hospital to respond to the stabbing and approached the victim who was being loud and verbally abusive while awaiting treatment for the stabbing. Shortly after approaching the victim, Cozzi placed him in handcuffs and left the emergency room to retrieve leg shackles, which he then placed on the victim. With the victim restrained, Cozzi used a sap to repeatedly strike him in the face and body. According to the plea agreement, at the time of the assault the victim posed no physical threat to Cozzi or anyone else at the hospital.<\/p>    <p>  Cozzi also admitted that he subsequently prepared a false arrest report and misdemeanor complaints stating that the victim attempted to punch him and two hospital security guards, as well as a false tactical response report stating that he used an \"open hand strike\" on the victim but omitted that he struck the victim with a sap.<\/p>    <p>  U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning set sentencing for March 26, 2009. Cozzi faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.<\/p>    <p>  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Drury from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.<\/p> #> 6   <p>  WASHINGTON – Phat Ngoc Tran, 35, pleaded guilty today in San Diego to conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, the \"Tran Organization,\" in a scheme to cheat at least 12 casinos across the United States and Canada out of millions of dollars, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen P. Hewitt for the Southern District of California announced today. Tran admitted that he and his co-conspirators unlawfully obtained up to $2.5 million during card cheats.<\/p>    <p>  A three-count indictment was returned May 22, 2007, and unsealed in the Southern District of California on May 24, 2007, charging Tran and 13 others each with one count of conspiracy to participate in the affairs of a racketeering enterprise; one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The indictment also charged five separate individuals each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.<\/p>    <p>  In his plea agreement, Tran admitted that on numerous occasions between approximately October 2002 and July 2006, he participated in gambling cheats together with other alleged members of the Tran Organization at casinos in the United States and Canada. Tran admitted to targeting at least 12 casinos in the racketeering conspiracy, including:<\/p>  <ul><li>Beau Rivage Casino, in Biloxi, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario, Canada;<\/li>  <li>Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn.;<\/li>  <li>Gold Strike Casino in Tunica, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino, in Bossier City, La.;<\/li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino and Hotel, in Tunica, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Isle of Capri Casino, in Westlake, La.;<\/li>  <li>Majestic Star Casino, in Gary, Ind.;<\/li>  <li>Mohegan Sun Resort Casino, in Uncasville, Conn.;<\/li>  <li>Palace Station Casino, in Las Vegas, Nev.;<\/li>  <li>Resorts East Chicago Hotel and Casino, in East Chicago, Ind.; and <\/li>  <li>Sycuan Casino, in El Cajon, Calif.<\/li>  <\/ul><p>  According to the indictment, the defendants and others executed a \"false shuffle\" cheating scheme at casinos in the United States and Canada during blackjack and mini-baccarat games. The indictment alleges that members of the criminal organization bribed casino card dealers and supervisors to perform false shuffles during card games, thereby creating \"slugs\" or groups, of un-shuffled cards. The indictment also alleges that after tracking the order of cards dealt in a card game, a member of the organization would signal to the card dealer to perform a \"false shuffle,\" and members of the group would then bet on the known order of cards when the slug appeared on the table. By doing so, members of the conspiracy repeatedly won thousands of dollars during card games, including winning up to $868,000 on one occasion.<\/p>    <p>  The indictment also alleges that the members of the organization used sophisticated mechanisms for tracking the order of cards during games, including hidden transmitter devices and specially created software that would predict the order in which cards would reappear during mini-baccarat and blackjack games.<\/p>    <p>  An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>    <p>  Tran’s sentencing is scheduled for June 1, 2009, in San Diego before U.S. District Judge John A. Houston. At sentencing, Tran faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the racketeering conspiracy charge.

                                                                                                                                                                              Remarks as DeliveredGood morning.I am joined today by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, FBI Director Chris Wray, Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Kenneth Polite, U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida Roger Handberg, and Europol Representative to the United States Lenno Reimand.We are here to announce that last night, the Justice Department dismantled an international ransomware network responsible for extorting and attempting to extort hundreds of millions of dollars from victims in the United States and around the world.Known as the “Hive” ransomware group, this network targeted more than 1,500 victims around the world since June of 2021. In ransomware attacks, transnational cybercriminals use malicious software to hold digital systems hostage and demand a ransom. Hive ransomware affiliates employed a double extortion model.First, they infiltrated a victim’s system and stole sensitive data. Next, the affiliates deployed malicious software, encrypting the victim's system, rendering it unusable. And finally, they demanded a ransom payment in exchange for a system decryption key and a promise not to publish any stolen data.Hive affiliates targeted critical infrastructure and some of our nation's most important industries.In one instance in August 2021, Hive affiliates deployed ransomware on computers owned by a Midwest hospital. At a time when COVID-19 was surging in communities around the world, the Hive ransomware attack prevented this hospital from accepting any new patients. The hospital was also forced to rely on paper copies of patient information. It was only able to recover its data after it paid a ransom.Hive’s most recent victim in the Central District of California was attacked on or about December 30 of last year. Its most recent victim in the [Middle] District of Florida was attacked around 15 days ago.In its first year of operation, Hive extorted over $100 million in ransom payments from its victims.           Last summer, FBI agents from the Tampa Division, with the support of prosecutors in the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and the Middle District of Florida infiltrated the Hive network and began disrupting Hive’s attempts to extort victims. For example, the FBI disrupted a Hive ransomware attack against a Texas school district’s computer systems. The Bureau provided decryption keys to the school district, saving it from making a $5 million ransom payment.That same month, the FBI disrupted a Hive ransomware attack on a Louisiana hospital, saving the victim from a $3 million ransom payment.The FBI was also able to disrupt an attack on a food services company. The Bureau provided the company with decryption keys and saved the victim from a $10 million ransom payment.Since July of last year, we provided assistance to over 300 victims around the world, helping to prevent approximately $130 million in ransom payments.Our continued investigative efforts led us to two back-end computer servers located in Los Angeles that were used by Hive to store the network’s critical information. Last night, pursuant to a court order, we seized those servers. We also received court authorization to wrest control of Hive's darknet sites and render its services unavailable.This morning, if a Hive affiliate tries to access their darknet site, this is what they will see.Our investigation into the criminal conduct of Hive members remains ongoing.I want to thank all of the agents, prosecutors, and staff across the Department for their work on this matter. I also want to thank the United States Secret Service, as well as all of our international partners, including Germany and the Netherlands, as well as our law enforcement partners at Europol.Cybercrime is a constantly evolving threat. But as I have said before, the Justice Department will spare no resource to identify and bring to justice, anyone, anywhere, who targets the United States with a ransomware attack.  We will continue to work both to prevent these attacks and to provide support to victims who have been targeted.And together with our international partners, we will continue to disrupt the criminal networks that deploy these attacks.I’m now going to turn over the podium over to

Prepared for DeliveryThank you, Mr. Attorney General.Over the last two years, the Attorney General and I have made clear that the department will use all the tools at its disposal, and work with partners to attack the ransomware threat from every angle.The department’s agents, prosecutors, and trial attorneys have partnered with law enforcement allies across the globe:To track ransom payments through the block chain and seize them back for victims;\\tTo dismantle ransomware networks;\\tTo warn targets of exigent ransomware threats to prevent attacks;\\tAnd to disrupt the criminal ecosystem that enables the targeting of innocent victims.We’ve made it clear that we will strike back against cyber crime using any means possible — today’s action reflects that strategy.We have also pledged to place victims at the center of our mission and prioritize prevention.As you’ll hear the FBI Director explain in greater detail, for the past several months the FBI and our prosecutors have been inside the network of one of the world’s most prolific ransomware variants: Hive.The FBI has labeled Hive a top 5 ransomware threat — both for its technical sophistication and for the harm it can inflict on victims.But, for all the group’s technical prowess, it could not outfox our prosecutors, our agents, and our international law enforcement coalition.Unbeknownst to HIVE, in a 21st century cyber stakeout, our investigative team lawfully infiltrated Hive’s network and hid there for months — repeatedly swiping decryption keys and passing them to victims to free them from ransomware.For months, we helped victims defeat their attackers and deprived the Hive network of extortion profits.Simply put, using lawful means, we hacked the hackers.We turned the tables on Hive and busted their business model, saving potential victims approximately $130 million dollars in ransomware payments.Successful actions like the one we announce today require the creative use of civil and criminal authorities, and they require partnerships – among law enforcement to be sure – but also with victims.Our actions in this investigation should speak clearly to those victims: it pays to come forward, and work with us.We are all in this together – we need your help to stop cybercriminals, to prevent future victims. In exchange, we pledge our tireless efforts to help you protect your systems and prevent or recover losses.When a victim steps forward it can make all the difference in recovering stolen funds or obtaining decryptor keys.Whether you own a small business, run a Fortune 500 company, oversee a school district, or manage a hospital — we can work with you to counter ransomware, mitigate harm, prevent losses, and strike back at the bad guys.Although today’s announcement marks an important success in the international fight against ransomware, we will not rest when it comes to Hive and its affiliates.If you target victims here in the United States, the Department of Justice will target you.And if you are a victim, know that the Department of Justice and the FBI are on the job, and we’ll be fighting for you and alongside you throughout your time of crisis.I’ll now turn the podium over to Director Wray. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Good afternoon, everyone.

I am so pleased to be part of this commemoration and to have the privilege of bringing today’s inspiring event to a close.I want to thank Kris Rose and our amazing team in the Office for Victims of Crime for making this day possible. And I’m grateful for the words of support and encouragement from our Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General Clarke. You can see that our commitment to human trafficking victims is truly embraced at the highest levels of the Department of Justice.We are, of course, very thankful to our speakers for giving us so much to think about and for motivating us to action. And we are grateful to everyone in this room for your leadership in your communities and for the work you do every day on behalf of human trafficking survivors.As our speakers have made clear, this work has never been more important. The more we learn about human trafficking, the more we appreciate the toll it takes on families, on communities and, especially, on individuals.But as we have heard today, these challenges can be eased through the support of compassionate providers, well-trained professionals and intentional action at all levels of government – and just as important, by amplifying the voices of survivors themselves.OVC is working hard, every day and in partnership with so many of you, to lift up the voices of human trafficking victims. OVC has grounded their programs and activities in what survivors tell us, improving and supporting responses that are trauma-informed, victim-centered, culturally relevant and tailored to the unique needs of every victim from every community.For example, the voices of survivors serve as the foundation for the National Standards of Care for Anti-Trafficking Service Providers, which ensures greater coordination and continuity of care and assistance. These standards are being developed in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Trafficking in Persons and will be informed by people with lived experience. They will articulate our expectation that federally-funded services should always be victim-centered and developmentally, culturally and linguistically appropriate.OVC’s contributions and leadership, and the contributions of everyone in this room, continue to move the field forward. Today, we are responding to human trafficking victims with deeper understanding of their needs, obstacles and interests. We’re providing more effective services and wider access to resources. And we’re helping to deliver a greater measure of justice to human trafficking survivors and a very real hope for a safer and brighter future.We have done this together, and I believe that the next 20 years will continue to advance the tremendous progress we have made over the last 20. I could not be more proud of what we have accomplished together, and I look forward to what we will achieve in the years ahead.I thank you all for being part of today’s commemoration, and on behalf of all of us at the Department of Justice, thank you for everything you do to support and assist survivors of human trafficking every day.This concludes our ceremony. #> 4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Remarks as DeliveredGood afternoon.  Thank you, Kris, for that very kind introduction. Today we recognize National Human Trafficking Prevention Month. And we recognize 20 years of anti-trafficking programs by the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime.Human trafficking is a heinous crime with devastating consequences.Traffickers prey upon the most vulnerable members of our society.They exploit and control their victims, often through force, violence, or abuse.And victims experience unimaginable harm, trauma, and stigma – all of which can prevent them from receiving the support they need and deserve.The Department of Justice is committed to combatting human trafficking from every angle, and to vindicating the rights of victims and survivors.We are committed to expanding our capacity to prevent human trafficking, including by working with federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners.We are committed to expanding our capacity to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking crimes across all 94 of our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices.Prosecutors in our Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit work closely with AUSAs and law enforcement agencies to streamline investigations, ensure consistent application of trafficking statutes, and identify multijurisdictional trafficking networks. In addition, in June 2021, I established Joint Task Force Alpha in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security. The Task Force’s mission is to work within the United States and with our foreign partners in the Northern Triangle and Mexico to dismantle the most dangerous human smuggling and human trafficking networks. The Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section helps lead and has numerous federal prosecutors assigned to the  Task Force. We also are committed to providing protection and trauma-informed assistance to victims and survivors of human trafficking.For two decades, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime has led our efforts to protect and support survivors.In that time, this work has greatly expanded. In 2003, we issued almost $10 million in grants to combat human trafficking. By 2022, we issued more than $90 million. And that figure will grow even more in the year ahead, with up to $95 million in awards available. I am proud that the funding OVC manages is the largest amount of federal funding dedicated to supporting survivors of human trafficking.This funding is used to support direct services for survivors, including housing, employment, and legal assistance. It also supports multidisciplinary task forces, state-level capacity building, and a range of training and technical assistance – all aimed at combatting human trafficking.Together, these resources help ensure the safety and wellbeing of survivors. These resources empower survivors to help bring their traffickers to justice, including through testimony and victim-impact statements.   And these resources help prevent future crimes. I am grateful to OVC – and to everyone involved in this work – for how much you have done to advance our anti-trafficking efforts thus far. But I am grateful more for how much you will continue to do in the years ahead. Your work has made a real difference in the lives of survivors across the country, and it will continue to do so year in and year out. Building an effective response to human trafficking takes commitment and collaboration at every level of government and beyond. It demands a multi-disciplinary approach, and partnerships between subject-matter experts, law enforcement, and stakeholders. And most important, it requires listening to victims and survivors and incorporating their perspectives into everything that we do. Nearly one year ago, I announced the Department’s National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking.This multi-year framework harnesses our law enforcement, prosecution, and grant-making capabilities to more effectively dismantling trafficking threats. The result is an approach to combating trafficking that puts victims first.And in the last year, we have put these policies into place.In support of the Strategy, we have released an updated version of the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance. This version incorporates enhanced protections and addresses specific considerations for vulnerable victims and members of marginalized communities. We have developed and disseminated expanded training resources for federal prosecutors, to offer strategies for enforcing restitution and forfeiture provisions for human trafficking victims.We have expanded the scope of our Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Human Trafficking, so that this program now covers both emergency and transitional housing.And we have launched an interagency Forced Labor Initiative to enhance the detection, investigation, and prosecution of federal criminal forced labor crimes. This initiative is led by a committee of experts from the FBI, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, and the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security.As I said, these are great strides forward. But there is much more to do. So, as we celebrate our accomplishments over the last 20 years, we will also recommit ourselves to doing this important work.We will continue to bring the full force of the Department to the fight against human trafficking. We will continue to bring traffickers to justice. We will continue to disrupt and dismantle the networks that enable these crimes. And we will continue to show victims, by word and by deed, that we are worthy of their trust.I’m now pleased to turn the podium back over to Kris. #> 5 Good morning! I am delighted to be with you all in New Orleans, the traditional and sacred homeland of the Chitimacha, Choctaw, Houma, and Biloxi peoples.I believe it is crucial that we acknowledge the original, rightful and continuing stewards of this land. However, that acknowledgment means little if not accompanied by action following the leadership of Tribal advocates and survivors.That is why it is so important for OVW to be here: to be guided by the voices of all who are here in this room today.Our work is driven by the principle that we cannot end violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women without centering Tribal sovereignty. And all OVW’s work – not just our Tribal Affairs Division but all our grants and policies – are only effective when they are informed by Tribal leaders and designees.In that vein, under the Violence Against Women Act – or VAWA – the Department of Justice, in coordination with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services, holds an annual government-to-government consultation with Tribal leaders on responding to violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women. OVW is honored to plan and host the consultation, which we held in Alaska for the first time ever last year.Every year at consultation, we hear powerful and sometimes heartbreaking testimony from Tribal leaders and designees who are living through the unbearable devastation of losing a loved one – of not knowing if someone missing will ever return.We cannot underestimate the role that sex trafficking has in these cases. Years ago, the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition (MIWSAC) was the first to tell me about the shocking rates of sex trafficking in Indian Country: MIWSAC told me that girls were being recruited or even abducted while waiting for the bus. MIWSAC is still leading the way in documenting the problem and identifying strategies to stop it.This year, we conducted site visits in Alaska, and we heard that Alaska Native youth who leave home for Anchorage are approached by traffickers within days of arriving. We heard about Alaska Native youth in foster care in Ketchikan who had been trafficked, though they wouldn’t have defined themselves as victims and needed culturally specific responses that met them where they were. And we heard about the role of fishing fleets and extractive industries in exacerbating sex trafficking.Tribes need tools to address this.Last year, VAWA was reauthorized and restored Tribes’ inherent sovereign jurisdiction to Tribes to prosecute non-Indian perpetrators of sex trafficking, among other offenses – including sexual violence and child abuse in the context of domestic violence – committed on Tribal lands.The law also expands this jurisdiction to Alaska Native villages, who were left out of the previous legal framework. These victories for Tribal sovereignty are thanks to the determined advocacy of so many represented at this conference.If you have ever doubted that your voice counts in Washington, just look at VAWA. People said it couldn’t be done but you made it happen.And you worked for these historic wins because you are in community with those who are directly impacted. You yourselves are impacted. You are supporting survivors every day, and COVID-19 introduced an entirely new set of shifting circumstances for you to overcome.So, I want to thank you not only for your work on VAWA 2022, but for being here today, and my special thanks to Nicole Matthews and everyone at MIWSAC, Men as Peacemakers, the Tribal Law and Policy Institute and Mending the Sacred Hoop for bringing us together for this incredibly important conference.Addressing the disproportionately high rates of violence experienced by Indigenous people, including sexual violence and sex trafficking and relatedly, the high rates of Indigenous people who are missing, is a priority not just for OVW but for the entire Department of Justice.The missing and murdered Indigenous persons – or MMIP – crisis requires trauma-informed, victim-centered responses from across the Department of Justice.Last year, the Department launched an MMIP page with helpful resources for survivors and their loved ones, Tribal communities, law enforcement agencies and officers, and service providers. That can be found at justice.gov/Tribal/mmip.But we know we have much more to do, and we are guided in that work by the words of Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, in her directive creating a Justice Department Steering Committee to address the MMIP crisis, “The Department recognizes that challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions, and the Steering Committee should therefore make Tribal engagement the cornerstone of its work.” I want to reiterate, “the challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions.”I serve on the Not Invisible Act Commission, and I am proud to see those Tribal solutions at the heart of the commission’s work.But of course, those Tribal solutions need funding to succeed, and we want to support you. We want to invest in you and help you succeed once you get those federal funds. We are posting new grant solicitations – some are already online now – and I must encourage you to apply. Most of our grants prioritize Tribal organizations or Tribal governments in some way, so please look at all our available solicitations and not just the ones specific to Tribes. Information on our grants, purpose areas, and how to apply can all be found on our website, and we’ve brought informational material for you to take.I’ve been an applicant and a grantee myself, so I know it’s not as easy as just saying “apply!” We are working hard to make applications simpler, and our Tribal Affairs Division has done great work to revise and streamline applications – particularly for our grants to support Tribes in implementing that newly broadened special Tribal criminal jurisdiction.Another opportunity to build your own capacity and help OVW fund more Tribal organizations is to be a peer reviewer of grant applications. The peer review process involves active professionals from the field assessing applications against the criteria in the solicitation and selecting the best in the pool. When you serve as a peer reviewer, you get a behind-the-scenes look at how to be a successful applicant.You also bring your unique expertise. You help ensure that applications from Tribes and Tribal organizations are being reviewed by people who understand those communities, by people from those very communities, by people who know what culturally specific services look like. You can visit OVW’s website for more information and fill out the recruitment form to submit via email.I want to close by thanking the survivors in the audience. To everyone who has struggled and is here today to turn that pain into action: we see you. We stand with you. We will fight side by side with you. We are going to change the world together.Thank you. #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Thank you.I want to reiterate the Attorney General’s thanks to the leadership and staff of the Antitrust Division for all their work to advance robust competition and to ensure that the American people have equal opportunity in the marketplace.I’d like to take a few moments to put this complaint into context.At its core, antitrust is about economic justice. And today’s landmark action against Google underscores that it is a priority of this Justice Department to fight the abuse of market power. We know that free and fair competition is essential to economic freedom. And we know that anticompetitive conduct threatens innovation, weakens workers’ rights, and stifles free expression. When any company, including a big technology company, violates the antitrust laws, our economy and our democracy suffer. Today’s complaint is a perfect example of why competition matters. Americans rely on the internet for news and for community. And advertising revenue is essential for publishers to produce and share ideas and writings. But we allege that Google has captured that revenue for its own profits and punished publishers who sought out alternatives. Those actions have weakened the free and open internet and increased advertising costs for businesses and for the United States government, including for our military.   Today’s complaint is also just one example of the department’s broader efforts to root out anticompetitive behavior regardless of how and where it might arise. Just a few months ago, the Antitrust Division scored a critical win for authors by blocking a merger of two major publishing houses, Penguin Random House and Simon &amp; Schuster. The merger would have substantially lessened authors’ compensation for their work and diminished opportunities for new authors to tell new stories. That merger was one of five that have been blocked or abandoned as a result of the division’s recent work; other abandoned mergers include two that would have strained the global supply chain by decreasing competition for shipping materials. And the Penguin Random House case is just one example of the department’s efforts to protect workers. This past summer, we secured an $85 million payment from poultry companies to settle allegations that they fixed workers’ wages and benefits.We have also reinvigorated criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act, including prosecutions for criminal wage-fixing, labor-market allocation, bid-rigging, and procurement fraud. And we have acted to ensure that corporate directors do not sit on competing boards, reviving a vital and underenforced rule of antitrust law.These efforts by the Antitrust Division are only a snapshot of the broader work happening across the department to advance economic justice, protect workers’ rights and ensure fair prices for products we use and rely on, like health insurance, airline tickets and food for our families. Today’s suit against Google exemplifies that we will continue to marshal our resources across divisions to promote competition and protect American workers and consumers.I’ll now turn it over to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who will speak more about the details of our complaint. #>      changed    created       date #> 1 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 2 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 3 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 4 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 5 2023-01-25 2023-01-25 2023-01-25 #> 6 2023-01-24 2023-01-24 2023-01-24 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  teaser #> 1 Good morning.
