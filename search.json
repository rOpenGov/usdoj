Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the \"Wordly\" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section. The IACP and IMPACT Section annual memberships allow members access to IACP policies, to network, and to gain from emailed policing information including webinars, good practices, and Quarterly IACP IMPACT Section international police Zoom meetings and presentations. Several ICITAP employees and contractors hold key positions in the leadership of the IACP and IACP IMPACT Section, which greatly enhances international police opportunities for all attendees hosted through ICITAP. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                On October 16, the ICITAP Courtroom Competency Training Team moderated its second “conversatorio” this year. Conversatorios are conversations between the judicial actors, including judges, prosecutors, defense and / or any other pertinent parties such as forensics experts, child advocates, etc. The goal is the creation of a space for honest dialogue to address and solve issues or problems that may arise in the administration and practice of justice in the state. This session was a first for the state of Guanajuato. Among those present were the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and Counselor of the Judicial Branch of the State of Guanajuato, and the Attorney General of the State. The Director of the ICITAP CCT Program welcomed the participants, which included approximately 63 public servants, including judges, magistrates, directors and heads of specialized units of Guanajuato’s Judicial Branch and Attorney General's Office, who actively participated in the sessions and discussions. Several public servants expressed their satisfaction with the quality and relevance of the topics addressed, as well as the practical usefulness. Four main topics were addressed at this first Guanajuato session. The first discussion highlighted the importance of presenting solid evidence at the initial appearance as a basis to link the suspect to the case and the need to standardize criteria between judges and prosecutors, which guarantees impartial and effective justice. The second topic was one that will likely affect the entire Mexican system based on a recent ruling by Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the importance of an exhaustive analysis of the data to justify preventive detention, promoting a consistent application of this measure for the benefit of public safety. Next, they discussed the effectiveness of the abbreviated procedure (plea agreement) mechanism to speed up judicial processes, with the commitment of the judiciary and the prosecutor's office to promote its use under the correct circumstances. Lastly, the coordinator for the Women’s Center for Justice discussed a proposal to create a specialized court for family violence and generated consensus on its importance to improve the protection of women and children, a crucial step towards a more inclusive and equitable justice system. This first meeting in Guanajuato between justice actors for the continuous improvement of the criminal justice system reaffirmed the importance of these spaces for discussion and mutual learning.

\\n      2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports \\n   \\n      On  October 13, 2011, the Office of Information Policy (OIP) will host a refresher  training session to go over the reporting requirements for Fiscal Year 2011  Annual FOIA Reports and 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&nbsp; Both reports must be submitted to OIP for  clearance prior to final posting.&nbsp; At the  training session the requirements for both reports will be reviewed and there  will be time for questions.&nbsp; The Annual  FOIA Report covers Fiscal Year 2011, while the 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Report  will cover agency activities from March 2011 to March 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp; \\n      Fiscal Year 2011 Annual  FOIA Reports\\n       Last year OIP provided agencies with  an Excel tool to be used in creating their Annual FOIA Reports.&nbsp; OIP will soon provide agencies with an  updated tool to create their Fiscal Year 2011 Annual FOIA Reports.&nbsp; Prior to the training, OIP will send agencies  a link along with instructions which will allow them to download the updated  tool.&nbsp; \\n      The tool will generate the Annual FOIA Report in  an open format, which is required by the Open Government Directive and will allow uploading of the data into FOIA.GOV.&nbsp; As was done in Fiscal Year 2010, agencies  must also publish their 2011 Annual FOIA Report in the PDF or similar  human-readable format traditionally used for publishing Annual FOIA  Reports.&nbsp; \\n      Agency Annual FOIA Reports in both  their open and human-readable formats should be submitted to OIP electronically  at DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov no later than December  5, 2011, in order to allow sufficient time for OIP to review them prior to  posting.\\n      After the reports are reviewed and  cleared by OIP, they should be posted on each agency’s website in both open  format and in the PDF or similar human-readable format.&nbsp;\\n  2012 Chief FOIA Officer  Reports\\n        On March 19, 2009, the Attorney General directed agency Chief  FOIA Officers to review “all aspects of their agencies’ FOIA administration”  and to report each year to the Department of Justice on the steps taken “to  improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their  agencies.”&nbsp;\\n      OIP will be issuing new reporting requirements  for the 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports, and prior to the meeting will post  these requirements on OIP’s Guidance page.&nbsp; The Chief FOIA Officer Reports should be  submitted to OIP electronically at DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov in either PDF or similar human-readable  format no later than February 1, 2012, to enable OIP to review and clear the  drafts for final posting.&nbsp;&nbsp; \\n      After the reports are reviewed and cleared by  OIP, they should be posted on each agency’s website no later than March 12,  2012.\\n      Training Details\\n      The details for the Refresher Training on Fiscal  Year 2011 Annual FOIA Reports and 2012 Chief FOIA Officer

Mediation Services Offered by OGIS\\n\\nAs part of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, the FOIA was amended to create the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) within the National Archives and Records Administration.&nbsp; OGIS opened in September 2009 and the Department of Justice provided agencies with details about this new office in FOIA Post.\\n\\nA significant new feature of FOIA administration is the offering of mediation services by OGIS to resolve disputes between requesters and agencies, as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.&nbsp; All agencies share the Department of Justice's goal to prevent disputes in the first instance.&nbsp; To the extent that disputes arise, however, mediation holds potential to resolve those disputes short of litigation.&nbsp; OGIS offers mediation services for just that purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nMediation is a voluntary process where a mediator assists the parties in resolving their dispute.&nbsp; The mediator is a third-party neutral with no authority to make a decision.&nbsp; The value of mediation is that the parties themselves, with the help of the mediator, devise an agreement to resolve their dispute.&nbsp; In the context of the FOIA, mediation is now offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.&nbsp; OGIS reports that both FOIA requesters and agencies have asked for its assistance and that OGIS has facilitated the resolution of a number of disputes, short of formal mediation, over the past few months.&nbsp; The OGIS case log and information about those cases are available on the OGIS website.\\n\\nIn order to ensure that all requesters know of this service, agencies should include in their final agency responses to requesters a standard paragraph notifying the requester that mediation services are offered by OGIS and giving contact information for that office.&nbsp; This notification to requesters should be provided at the conclusion of the administrative process within the agency, i.e., as part of the agency's final response on administrative appeal.&nbsp; This will allow requesters to first exhaust their administrative remedies within the agency.&nbsp; Agencies should also, of course, continue to provide requesters with notification of their right to seek judicial review.&nbsp; OGIS offers language that agencies might wish to use as a model for notifying requesters of its services.\\n\\nResolving FOIA disputes through mediation holds the potential to reduce litigation, thereby saving time and money for agencies and requesters alike, as well as enhancing the operation of the FOIA and public collaboration.\\n #> 3

                        Annual FOIA Report Q &amp; As\\n\\nQ: When one component of an agency receives a consultation sent from another component of the same agency, should the receiving component count that incoming consultation in Section XII of the Annual FOIA Report?\\n\\nYes. Section XII of the Annual FOIA Report requires agencies, and agency components, to report information about consultations that they have received from other agencies as well as those received from other components within their own agency.\\n\\nAgencies and agency components should be careful to report only consultations received from other agencies or from other components of their agency, and to not include consultations that they have sent to other agencies and/or components.\\n\\nQ: When an agency receives, processes and responds to a FOIA request all on the same day, how should the agency report the response time for that request in the Annual FOIA Report?\\n\\nWhen an agency FOIA office receives a request directly from the requester and it is the proper FOIA office to have received the request, if that office processes and responds to the request within that same day, the agency should report this response time as \"\\n\\nStarting with requests received December 31, 2008, this rule will likewise apply when a FOIA office receives a misdirected request from another FOIA office in its agency which had routed it to the proper office on or before the tenth day from the original date of receipt. See FOIA Post, \"New Requirement to Route Misdirected FOIA Requests\" (posted 11/18/2008). In other words, when the proper FOIA office receives, processes and responds to a request on the same day and that day is the tenth day, or earlier, of the routing period, the proper FOIA office should report the response time for that request as \"\\n\\nThis rule, on the other hand, will not apply if a FOIA office receives a misdirected request from another FOIA office in its agency if the proper office receives the request later than ten days from the original date of receipt. In this instance, the proper FOIA office must count the tenth day of the routing period as the beginning of the twenty-day response period and count forward accordingly to determine its response time for that request. Therefore, if, for example, the proper FOIA office receives the routed request on the eleventh day (rather than on or before the tenth day of the routing period) that day constitutes \"day 1\" of the twenty-day response period. In this example, if the proper FOIA office processed and responded to that request on the same day it received the request from the receiving FOIA office, it would report its response time as one day, not less than one day.\\n\\nQ: How should agencies account for requests which have been remanded following administrative appeal?\\n\\nIt is important that agencies keep track of the time spent on any request that is remanded for further processing after administrative appeal. In order to track a remanded request and capture the time taken to process it, agencies may give the remanded request a new number, or annotate the original tracking number to reflect that it has been remanded. The time spent processing a remanded request should then be included in the agency's Annual FOIA Report, just as is done for all other FOIA requests.\\n #> 4 Since 1991, OPDAT has provided expert assistance and case-based mentoring to foreign counterparts to develop justice systems that can combat transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism consistent with international standards (e.g., the UN Convention against Corruption). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of related crime throughout the world, OPDAT provides foreign counterparts with tailored assistance and case-based mentoring – within the scope of its authorized activities – to help detect, investigate and prosecute wrongdoing related to the pandemic. Specifically, OPDAT helps counterparts combat:\\n\\n\\n\\tcybercrime, cyber-enabled crime (e.g., online fraud) and intellectual property crime;\\n\\tpublic-procurement corruption;\\n\\tgender-based / domestic violence; and\\n\\tthe spread of COVID-19.\\n\\n\\nOPDAT also:\\n\\n\\n\\tsupports the rule of law generally during the pandemic.\\n\\t&nbsp;\\n\\n\\nIn carrying out this assistance and case-based mentoring, OPDAT relies on its unique access to some of the most experienced criminal justice experts in the nation: the Department of Justice’s over 5,000 Assistant U.S. Attorneys and 600 Criminal Division attorneys. These experts include COVID – 19 Coordinators for their respective U.S. Attorneys Offices, as well as attorneys from the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). They share with foreign counterparts their experiences in combatting COVID-19 related crime, including fraud and corruption and cyber-enabled and intellectual property crime. OPDAT’s programs are funded through interagency agree­ments between OPDAT and U.S. Government partners, primarily the U.S. Department of State.\\n\\n(1) Combatting cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and intellectual property crime:\\n\\nThe U.S. Transnational and High-Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN) program is the result of a partnership between the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Affairs (DOS/INL) and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (DOJ/CCIPS) and Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (DOJ/OPDAT).\\n\\nThe GLEN is a global law enforcement capacity-building network of International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (ICHIP) prosecutors, computer forensic analysts, and federal law enforcement agents focused on delivering training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement partners to combat intellectual property and cybercrime activity, as well as to assist in the collection and use of electronic evidence to combat all types of crime, including transnational organized crime (TOC).\\n\\nCurrently, ICHIPs are posted to regional positions in Africa (Abuja, Nigeria), Asia (Hong Kong S.A.R. and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), Europe (Bucharest, Romania, and the Hague), and Western Hemisphere (Sao Paulo, Brazil). Two subject-matter expert ICHIPs -- the ICHIP for Internet Fraud and Public Health (IFPH) and the ICHIP for Dark Web and Cryptocurrency (DWC) -- as well as DOJ computer forensic analysts and law enforcement officials with intellectual property and cybercrime expertise also form part of the GLEN.&nbsp; Later this year, ICHIPs also will be posted to Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

OPDAT and CCIPS helped troubleshoot some problems associated with the rollout to ensure the continued use of “E-Inquest.” The workshop is now sought after by other Philippine justice sector partners who seek to employ similar means to carry out their mission amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Metro Manila and other cities in the Philippines are locked down with all courts closed for in-person hearings. The Philippine Supreme Court issued a directive for courts to use video conference court hearings for urgent criminal matters involving detainees. In response, OPDAT and CCIPS immediately hosted an online roundtable for a Cebu City Regional Trial Court judge, his staff, the city jail warden, and representatives from the prosecution and public defender’s office. Due to growing demand, ODPAT and CCIPS will provide future roundtables for other courts.&nbsp;\\n\\t&nbsp;\\n\\tEl Salvador: El Salvadorian police have struggled to properly enforce the country’s quarantine law.&nbsp; OPDAT helped develop guidelines, which&nbsp;can be used by police to help them properly and fairly enforce the law.&nbsp;Separately, an OPDAT-mentored judge and alumnus of OPDAT’s Judicial Studies Institute inspected the conditions at a COVID-19 quarantine facility.

Marking Documents for Release in Accordance with the OPEN Government Act\\n\\nSection 12 of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, amended Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which contains the requirement that agencies provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information contained in documents that are responsive to FOIA requests. Since the 1996 amendments to the FOIA, agencies have been required to indicate the amount of information deleted on the released portion of the record, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. See Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-231, § 4, 110 Stat. 3048-49 (concluding sentences); see also FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 1, at 6 (\"Amendment Implementation Questions\"); FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 2, at 2 (\"FOIA Counselor: Questions &amp; Answers\"). Moreover, the FOIA provides that if technically feasible, the amount of the withheld information should be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion is made.\\n\\nThe OPEN Government Act added one additional requirement to this provision regarding the duty to segregate documents for release. Specifically, Section 12 of the OPEN Government Act provides that when marking documents to indicate the amount of information deleted, and the location of that deletion, agencies should also indicate the exemption being asserted. This straightforward requirement codifies what has been an existing practice for many agencies and follows the approach long recommended by the Office of Information and Privacy (OIP).\\n\\nAmended Segregation Provision\\n\\nSection (b) of the FOIA, which contains the FOIA's nine statutory exemptions, also directs agencies to release to FOIA requesters any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information that is contained in those records. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (sentence immediately following exemptions). As amended by the OPEN Government Act, the provision now reads:\\n\\n\\nAny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated on the released portion of the record unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (amended language in italics).\\n\\n\\nThe requirement to provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the records that are responsive to FOIA requests is a fundamental tenant of the Act. Indeed, courts have long focused on this requirement. See, e.g., Department of Justice Freedom of Information Act Guide (Mar. 2007), at 113-19 (\"Reasonably Segregable\" Obligation) (collecting cases); id. at 1005-10 (\"Reasonably Segregable\" Requirements) (likewise collecting cases). Thus, it is important that agencies remain mindful of the need to reasonably segregate and release any non-exempt information whenever they are processing a FOIA request. See, e.g., Stolt-Neilsen Transp. Group Ltd. v. United States, 534 F.3d 728, 734 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (concluding that the district court has an affirmative duty to consider reasonable segregability even if the requester never raised the issue).\\n\\nThe remaining elements of the segregation provision, including the new statutory amendment, address how documents should be marked once it is determined that they contain reasonably segregable, non-exempt information. First, the amount of information that is being withheld, and now also the exemption under which the withholding is being made, should be indicated on the released portion of the record itself. The FOIA has long contained an exception to this requirement for those instances where revealing the amount and location of the information being redacted would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. This exception now also includes the situation where revealing the exemption itself on the face of the released-in-part document would harm an interest protected by the exemption. In such rare circumstances, the agency need not mark the released portion of the document in such a way that by doing so would cause harm to an interest protected by the exemption being asserted.\\n\\nFor example, if a portion of an otherwise releaseable document is being protected under Exemption 7(A) to prevent interference with an on-going law enforcement investigation, and if the agency determines that indicating the amount of information being deleted under that exemption, or now, that marking Exemption 7(A) on that portion of the document will, in context with the released portions of the record, interfere with the on-going investigation, then the agency need not include those markings on that particular record. Such situations will be rare, however, and any agency processing a request which raises questions as to whether the FOIA's marking provisions apply to a given document are encouraged to contact OIP.\\n\\nIn the vast majority of cases, the exception to the marking requirement is not applicable. As a result, the three marking requirements will ordinarily apply. Those requirements direct agencies to indicate the amount of information being withheld on the released portion of the record itself. As a result of the OPEN Government Act, agencies must now also mark the document to show the exemption under which the deletion is being made. The third marking requirement provides that agencies must, if technically feasible, place that indication as to the amount of information being deleted and the exemption being asserted, at the place in the record where the deletion occurs. Thus, a FOIA requester reviewing documents released in part would be able to see directly, in the context of the released portions of the document, how much material has been withheld, the exemption used to make the withholding, and where within the document the deletion occurred.\\n\\nMarking Documents for Release\\n\\nFor most records the marking requirements will be readily met by \"blacking out\" or otherwise physically marking through the protected information in the record and then inserting a notation regarding the exemption being asserted for that particular deletion. The volume of the withheld material will be apparent from the \"blacked out\" portions, as will the location within the document where the excision occurs.\\n\\nIn light of this, it is important that agencies do not \"white out\" information when withholding it under the FOIA, as that can make it difficult for a requester to identify the amount of withheld material and its location within a document. Instead, agencies must mark documents in a way that makes it readily apparent to the requester where within a document information has been withheld. This can be accomplished by darkening, or \"blacking out\" the withheld portions of the documents, or by inserting brackets around them, or by outlining or \"boxing\" them, or any other method that ensures that a requester can easily discern where the redactions have been made. Further, each page containing redactions should be marked to show the amount of information being withheld and the exemption being asserted and, if technically feasible, those markings should be placed at the point in the record where the deletion occurs.\\n\\nThe following examples demonstrate several possible approaches to marking documents so that the newly added requirement to specify the exemption being asserted is met. One of the clearest ways to do that is to insert a notation as to the exemption being asserted within the space that remains after the information has been excised.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen a paragraph or group of paragraphs are withheld on a page, the exemption(s) used to protect the information in the paragraphs may similarly be noted within the marked-out space.\\n\\n\\n\\nYet another approach is to use an arrow to connect a particular redaction to the annotation indicating the applicable exemption(s), or to include the exemption notation at the end of the line where the excision occurs.\\n\\n\\n\\nThese examples are illustrative and are not intended to be exclusive. Agencies will likely employ a variety of techniques to mark documents depending on the nature of the documents at issue and the redaction capabilities of the agency. The key requirement for agencies when marking documents that will be released in part is to comply with the overall purpose of the segregation provision which is to readily reveal to a requester the amount of information being withheld in a document, its location within that document, and the exemption being asserted for that redaction.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nAgencies have long been required to segregate documents for release and to mark those documents to indicate the amount of information deleted and, ordinarily, the location of the deletion. The new statutory provisions of the OPEN Government Act simply add the next logical step to that requirement, mandating that the exemption being asserted in connection with a given deletion be indicated directly at the place of the deletion. The purpose of the amendment is to make it plain on the face of any record disclosed in part the agency's statutory basis for each discrete withholding contained within the document.\\n #> 6

Reports\\n\\n\\nFor the Fiscal Year 2011 Annual FOIA Reports, OIP will once again be providing agencies with an Excel tool to be used in creating their report.&nbsp; This tool, which is very similar to the one that OIP distributed last year, has many features to assist agencies in compiling their data, including built-in math checks.&nbsp; The tool will also generate the Annual FOIA Report in an open format, which is required by the Open Government Directive and is used to upload data onto FOIA.Gov.&nbsp; OIP anticipates sending agencies a link which will allow agencies to download the updated tool prior to the refresher training on Annual FOIA Reports that will be held this Fall.&nbsp; Agencies should also publish their 2011 Annual FOIA Report in the PDF or similar human-readable format traditionally used for publishing Annual FOIA Reports.\\n\\n\\n #>   changed created date #> 1    <NA>    <NA> <NA> #> 2    <NA>    <NA> <NA> #> 3    <NA>    <NA> <NA> #> 4    <NA>    <NA> <NA>

Kirkpatrick. He also was ordered to pay restitution to his victims and a $7,500 assessment pursuant to the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Assistance Act of 2018.&nbsp;“Few crimes are as heinous as the sexual exploitation of minors,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kirkpatrick. “My office will continue to prioritize charging predators who hold positions of trust in our community. &nbsp;Coaches, daycare providers, and others in positions of trust who prey on children will face federal justice.” &nbsp;“The sentencing of Lucas Mathew Kramer concludes a successful investigation focused on those who seek to exploit our children. HSI will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who target our young people,” said ICE HSI Saint Paul Special Agent in Charge Jamie Holt. “We appreciate the collaboration with our law enforcement partners and stand by our commitment to protecting our communities and securing our homeland.”According to court documents, on September 23, 2022, law enforcement received a tip that an online individual with the username “northernboy35” had used the Kik messenger application to upload 19 videos of child pornography to the internet. Less than a week later, the same username uploaded five additional child pornography videos to the internet. Law enforcement quickly determined that the uploaded files originated from Duluth, Minnesota, and linked the email and IP address for the “nothernboy35” moniker directly to Lucas Mathew Kramer, 45, a longtime collegiate climbing coach.&nbsp;Law enforcement proceeded to execute a search warrant at Kramer’s residence and discovered that he had knowingly possessed over 600 images and videos of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on numerous electronic devices. His CSAM collection included the graphic sexual abuse of prepubescent children—some as young as toddlers—and included videos depicting children being physically forced into sexual compliance. Kramer admitted that he downloaded and traded his CSAM collection with others on the internet. Law enforcement also discovered evidence of sexually explicit chats between Kramer and self-identified prepubescent minors, where he engaged the self-identified minors in sexually explicit conversations and encouraged them to take and send nude images of themselves. &nbsp; &nbsp;Kramer pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography on October 11, 2024. He was sentenced in U.S. District Court by Judge Eric C. Tostrud on March 19, 2024. When handing down the sentence, Judge Tostrud remarked that Kramer’s conduct was “deeply troubling” and that his collection of CSAM materials “reflected depravity” and showed a “callous indifference” to the humanity of his victims.This case is the result of an investigation conducted by Homeland Security Investigations and the Duluth Police Department. “The Duluth Police Department appreciates its partnership with Homeland Security Investigations in holding this offender accountable to the highest standards,” commented Duluth Police Chief Mike Ceynowa.The case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorney’s Offices and the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section (CEOS), Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state, and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

Ramsdell announced today that&nbsp;U.S. District Judge Camela C. Theeler has sentenced an Oglala, South Dakota, man following his conviction for two counts of Receipt of Child Pornography.&nbsp;The sentencing took place on March 17, 2025.Johnathan Morrison, 34, was sentenced to eight years and nine months in federal prison on each count for a total of 210 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release on each count with the time to run concurrently, and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment to the Federal Crime Victims Fund for each count. Morrison was also ordered to pay $95 in restitution to the South Dakota Internet Crimes Investigation Fund and to forfeit his interest in a smartphone. He will also be required to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.A federal grand jury indicted Morrison in February of 2024. He pleaded guilty on January 8, 2025.In August 2023, Morrison solicited a 10-year old female to engage in sexually explicit conduct over social media. Shortly thereafter, an adult learned that Morrison had enticed the child and reported Morrison’s criminal actions to the Oglala Sioux Tribe Department of Public Safety. Morrison was immediately apprehended and arrested. His smartphone was seized as evidence. An extraction of his smartphone revealed that prior to August 2023, Morrison downloaded and installed multiple social media platforms, including KIK, Telegram, and Snapchat onto his cellular device. Through these platforms, Morrison solicited, sent, and received images and videos containing child pornography. Some of the images recovered involved prepubescent females engaged in sexual acts. Through his chats, investigators learned that Morrison had an interest in 10-14 year old females. The search also revealed that Morrison had made sexual advances to his girlfriend’s teenage daughter and that he had covertly photographed her over 130 times with his smartphone.This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.

She was also ordered to pay over&nbsp;$20 million in restitution to the IRS.Beatriz Toledo, 61, owned&nbsp;Immigration and Tax Service Group LLC. For tax years 2017 through 2021, Toledo,&nbsp;through her company, willfully prepared false and fraudulent tax returns for clients, which included false claims for the Residential Energy Credit (allowing taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified energy-saving expenses), false itemized deductions for state and local sales taxes, and false business expenses. Through these false claims, Toledo’s clients’ taxable income decreased, leading to bigger tax refunds.During the scheme, Toledo submitted about 7,800 tax returns with fraudulent claims for residential energy tax credits, resulting in her clients’ underpayment of about $20 million in federal taxes. Toledo’s company received approximately $7.1 million in tax preparation fees that it took directly out of clients’ refund checks.Toledo engaged in this criminal conduct in violation of a permanent injunction previously entered against her by a federal district judge in 2010. Case No. 09-cv-21987-COOKE. In that civil case, the United States sued to bar Toledo from preparing false tax returns. Toledo agreed to a permanent injunction, which the district court entered on July 26, 2020. The injunction prohibited her from engaging in the conduct described above. Despite the injunction’s prohibitions, Toledo continued to prepare false tax returns and was indicted in 2024.&nbsp;U.S. Attorney Hayden P.

operators of two Miami medical clinics, along with a phlebotomist at one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney R. Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced today.<\/p>    <p>  <\/p>    <p>  Juan A. \"Tony\" Marrero, 41, Belkis Marrero, 41, and Luz Borrego, 43, each pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2009, to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in the Southern District of Florida. In their pleas, Tony and Belkis Marrero admitted that they co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;P).<\/p>    <p>  Medcore and M&amp;P purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. The Marreros admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 they conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Borrego acknowledged her role in the fraud at Medcore where she was a phlebotomist who administered unnecessary drugs intravenously to HIV patients. Tony Marrero also pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracies to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud. Sentencing for all three defendants is scheduled for April 3, 2009.<\/p>    <p>  During their pleas, the defendants admitted that Medcore and M&amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare and that the treatments for infused or injected drugs billed to Medicare were not medically necessary. Each of the defendants also admitted that all of the patients at the clinics were participants in the fraud. The defendants admitted that they, or their co-conspirators, entered into kickback arrangements with these Medicare beneficiaries whereby the beneficiaries were paid every week in exchange for their Medicare billing information, which allowed the clinics to submit the fraudulent bills.<\/p>    <p>  To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Tony Marrero admitted that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.<\/p>    <p>  The defendants admitted that none of the Medicare beneficiaries needed the injection and infusion treatments billed to Medicare by the clinics. Tony and Belkis Marrero acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Belkis Marrero and Borrego also admitted that they put together medical files to make them appear legitimate and that they supported the treatments being billed to Medicare.<\/p>    <p>  On Jan. 7, 2009, Orlando Pascual Jr., a co-owner of Medcore and M&amp;P, pleaded guilty to his role in the Medicare fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a separate durable medical equipment company that he operated from 2001 to 2003.<\/p>    <p>  On Jan. 14, 2009, Harold Sio, the owner of pharmaceutical wholesale company named Lifecare Medical, was charged by criminal information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sio, whose company supplied Medcore and M&amp;P with infusible drugs, allegedly conspired with Pascual and Tony Marrero to accomplish the health care fraud scheme by providing false invoices for the drugs allegedly used in the scheme.<\/p>    <p>  Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 9, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment and an information are merely charges, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>    <p>  The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S. (Jay) Darden, and Trial Attorney Charles Reed of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General and the FBI. The case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (MFSF), supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and U.S. Attorney Acosta of the Southern District of Florida. Since the inception of MFSF operations, federal prosecutors have indicted 106 cases with 190 defendants in both Los Angeles and Miami. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for more than half a billion dollars.<\/p> #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               <p>  WASHINGTON - A federal court has ordered CPA Steven W. McCann, who operates a firm called SWMc Services in the Houma, La., area, to stop claiming improper tax deductions on federal income tax returns he prepares for customers, the Justice Department announced today. McCann agreed to the civil injunction order.<\/p>    <p>  According to the <a href=\"http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/txdv081077.htm\">  <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">    <span style=\"color: #0000ff;\">  government complaint<\/span><\/span><\/a> filed in the case, McCann prepared nearly 1,000 federal income tax returns claiming fraudulent employee expense deductions for customers who work as mariners. The government alleged that these deductions were false because the expenses McCann claimed for his customers were never paid by the clients. Instead, their employers provided the items being deducted, including meals and other incidental expenses.

Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio; and C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).<\/p>    <p>  Zubair Ahmed and his cousin Khaleel Ahmed each pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge James G. Carr in Toledo, Ohio, to a one-count, superseding information charging them with conspiracy to provide material support and resources, including the defendants themselves as personnel, to terrorists in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. Section 2339A. At sentencing, each defendant faces a statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, followed by three years of supervised release.<\/p>    <p>  According to the superseding information and other information entered into the court record today:<\/p>    <p>  The criminal conspiracy involving Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed began no later than April 1, 2004, and continued until their arrests on Feb. 21, 2007. As part of the conspiracy, the defendants made preparations to travel overseas in order to engage in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in either Iraq or Afghanistan. On or about May 21, 2004, the defendants traveled to Cairo, Egypt, with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.<\/p>    <p>  After their return from Egypt, on or about July 4, 2004, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed discussed, sought and received instruction on firearms from another individual in Cleveland. The defendants also sought and discussed training in counter-surveillance techniques and sniper rifles with this individual. Specifically, defendant Zubair Ahmed discussed his desire to learn how to use and move with a .50-caliber machine gun.<\/p>    <p>  As part of the conspiracy, the defendants also communicated with each other using code words and in a foreign language to disguise their preparations and plans to engage in acts abroad that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.<\/p>    <p>  Furthermore, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed researched the purchase of firearms, methods of obtaining firearms instruction (including at least one visit to a firing range) and methods of obtaining instruction in gunsmithing. In addition, the defendants collected and distributed videos of attacks on U.S. military forces overseas, manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry.<\/p>    <p>  \"Today’s guilty pleas should send a strong message to individuals who would use this country as a platform to plot attacks against U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \"This case also underscores the need for continued vigilance in identifying and dismantling extremist plots that develop within our nation.\"<\/p>    <p>  William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said: \"These guilty pleas are testament to the hard work and dedication of all the federal, state and local law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating this case and to the tireless efforts and perseverance of an extremely talented team of federal prosecutors who, with their law enforcement partners, keep this country safe from terrorists.\"<\/p>    <p>  C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division, FBI, said: \"This case is an example of our continued efforts to detect terrorist planning and to prevent acts of terrorism before they occur.&nbsp; Through close cooperation with our law enforcement partners in Illinois and Ohio, this case resulted in the successful prosecution of these individuals.\"<\/p>    <p>  This case was investigated by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Chicago, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio, with the assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Chicago Police Department; the Illinois State Police; the Ohio Highway Patrol; the Toledo Police Department; and the Lucas and Wood County Sheriff’s Departments.&nbsp;<\/p>    <p>  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E.

The Department opened its investigation of Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals in 2007 and issued findings regarding Georgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta on May 30, 2008. The Department subsequently entered into negotiations regarding remedies the State was required to implement to correct unconstitutional conditions at all the hospitals. The other state facilities involved in today’s settlement include: Georgia Regional Hospital at Savannah, Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Southwestern State Hospital, East Central State Hospital, West Central State Hospital, and Northwest Georgia Regional Hospital at Rome.<\/p>    <p>  \"When a state undertakes to care for persons with mental illness and developmental disabilities, it accepts responsibility to protect them from harm,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"The Department commends Governor Sonny Perdue, State Attorney General Thurbert Baker, and the Georgia Department of Human Resources for their willingness to work aggressively to address the conditions at these seven psychiatric hospitals. The leadership of the State in amicably resolving this matter has been paramount to today's exceptional result on behalf of the people of the State of Georgia. We are pleased that we have cooperatively achieved a settlement agreement that will benefit the lives of persons with mental health problems and developmental disabilities in Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals.\"<\/p>    <p>  Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the State will work to ensure that patients at the seven hospitals are safe and receive the care and services necessary to meet their individualized needs. Specifically, the State has agreed to undertake a variety of measures, including improving medical and mental health care and ensuring that patients are free from undue bodily restraint. The State will also improve discharge planning and ensure that each patient is served in the most integrated setting appropriate.<\/p>    <p>  Today's settlement with the State of Georgia is the result of a cooperative effort by State entities and the Justice Department to reach a settlement that will make meaningful changes to improve the care and treatment of patients at Georgia’s seven psychiatric hospitals. This Administration is firmly committed to the vigorous protection of the rights of persons with disabilities.<\/p>    <p>  The Civil Rights Division is authorized to conduct investigations of public psychiatric hospitals under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). This statute allows the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses such as those discovered in Georgia. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations in other in-patient mental health facilities in the District of Columbia, Vermont, and California, among other states.

SouthernCare operates approximately 99 locations that provide hospice services in 15 states.<\/p>    <p>  Hospices provide palliative care – any form of medical care or treatment that concentrates on reducing the severity of a disease’s symptoms – to patients who decide to forego curative care of their illness. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to hospice care if they have a terminal prognosis of six months or less to live. The government alleged that SouthernCare was submitting false claims for hospice care for patients who were not eligible for such care.<\/p>    <p>  \"The Medicare hospice benefit is intended to provide compassionate end of life care to terminally ill patients,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division. \"This settlement sends a clear message that the Department of Justice will not allow health care providers to take advantage of beneficiaries in their attempts to game the reimbursement system.\"<\/p>    <p>  Today’s settlement results from two qui tam suits filed by two former SouthernCare employees, Tanya Rice and Nancy Romeo, on behalf of the United States. The False Claims Act authorizes private parties to file suit against those who defraud the United States and to receive a share of any recovery. The United States will pay $4.9 million to the individuals who filed the actions against SouthernCare.<\/p>    <p>  \"Our investigation showed a pattern and practice to falsely admit patients to hospice care who did not qualify and to bill Medicare for that care. This resulted in taxpayers bearing inappropriate costs. Today’s settlement evidences the Department of Justice’s efforts to both protect the public monies and safeguard Medicare beneficiaries,\" said Alice H. Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.<\/p>    <p>  \"This significant settlement demonstrates our commitment to protect the Medicare trust fund from fraud and abuse and to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality care,\" said David E. Nahmias, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia,. \"Every provider that submits claims to the Medicare program must ensure that its services are billed appropriately. Falsely admitting people to hospice care who did not qualify for the benefit exposed these patients to potential harm and contributes to the soaring costs of health care for everyone.\"<\/p>    <p>  As part of the settlement, SouthernCare will enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to address the allegations raised in the qui tam complaints.<\/p>    <p>  \"Today’s Corporate Integrity Agreement contains rigorous provisions specifically designed to ensure SouthernCare’s future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid hospice eligibility requirements,\" said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General for HHS.&nbsp;\"This agreement demonstrates OIG’s commitment to protect the integrity of federal health care programs.\"<\/p>    <p>  The investigation was jointly handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northen District of Georgia, the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI.<\/p> #> 6   <p>  WASHINGTON — Executives from LG Display Co. Ltd. and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. have agreed to plead guilty and serve jail time in the United States for participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) panels, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today.<\/p>    <p>  According to a one-count felony charge filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chang Suk \"C.S.\" Chung, a Korean LG executive, conspired with unnamed employees from other panel makers to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels from on or about Sept. 21, 2001, to on or about June 1, 2006. According to a separate one-count felony charge, also filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chieng-Hon \"Frank\" Lin, a Taiwanese former executive from Chunghwa, and Chih-Chun \"C.C.\" Liu and Hsueh-Lung \"Brian\" Lee, Taiwanese current employees of Chungwha, are charged with participating in the same conspiracy at various times during the period from Sept. 14, 2001, to on or about Dec. 1, 2006.<\/p>    <p>  Under the plea agreements, which must be approved by the court, all four executives have agreed to serve a term of imprisonment, pay a criminal fine and assist the government in its ongoing TFT-LCD investigation.<\/p>    <p>  TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. In 2006, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was approximately $70 billion.<\/p>    <p>  \"These cases involve the first Taiwanese nationals to face imprisonment in the United States for an antitrust offense,\" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department of Justice is committed to holding accountable all conspirators who harm American consumers, no matter where they live or where they commit the crime.\"<\/p>    <p>  During the conspiracy, Chang Suk Chung, a Korean citizen, worked as LG’s Vice President of Monitor Sales. Under the plea agreement, Chung has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $25,000 criminal fine.<\/p>    <p>  During the charged conspiracy period, Chieng-Hon Lin, a Taiwanese and U.S. citizen, was Chunghwa’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Under the plea agreement, Lin has agreed to serve a nine-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $50,000 criminal fine.<\/p>    <p>  Chih-Chun Liu, a Taiwanese citizen, was Chunghwa’s Vice President of LCD Sales during the charged conspiracy period. Under the plea agreement, Liu has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $30,000 criminal fine.<\/p>    <p>  Hsueh-Lung Lee, a Taiwanese citizen, held various sales positions at Chunghwa during the charged conspiracy period, including Vice President of LCD Sales. Under the plea agreement, Lee has agreed to serve a six-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $20,000 criminal fine.<\/p>    <p>  These four foreign-based executives were charged with participating with co-conspirators in a conspiracy that was accomplished by:<\/p>  <ul>  <li>Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT-LCD panels;<\/li>  <li>Agreeing during these meetings, conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT-LCD panels at certain predetermined levels;<\/li>  <li>Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached;<\/li>  <li>Exchanging information on sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices; and<\/li>  <li>Authorizing, ordering and consenting to the participation of subordinate employees in the conspiracy.<\/li>  <\/ul>    <p>  \"These are the first individuals to plead guilty to a charge of fixing prices in this active investigation into antitrust violations in the TFT-LCD industry,\" said Scott D. Hammond, the Antitrust Division’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement. \"We will continue in our efforts to bring to justice other domestic and foreign-based executives who were involved with fixing TFT-LCD prices.\"<\/p>    <p>  On Dec. 15, 2008, LG pleaded guilty to participating in this conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $400 million criminal fine – the second largest fine in Antitrust Division history. On Jan. 14, 2009, Chunghwa pleaded guilty to participating in the same conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $65 million criminal fine.<\/p>    <p>  On Dec. 16, 2008, Sharp Corp. pleaded guilty to three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels sold to Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc., and was sentenced to pay a $120 million criminal fine.<\/p>    <p>  The four executives are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of $1 million and up to 10 years in prison for an individual. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.<\/p>    <p>  These pleas are the result of a joint investigation by the Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Field Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Francisco.<\/p>    <p>  Anyone with information concerning illegal conduct in the TFT-LCD industry is urged to call the San Francisco Field Office of the Antitrust Division at 415-436-6660.<\/p> #>   changed created       date number #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-042 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-045 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-041 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-048 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-043 #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-046 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         teaser #> 1                                                                                                                      The owners and operators of two Miami medical clinics, along with a phlebotomist at one of the clinics, have pleaded guilty to defrauding the Medicare program in connection with a $5.3 million HIV and cancer infusion fraud scheme.  #> 2                                                                                          A federal court has ordered CPA Steven W.
