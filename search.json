Opening remarks were provided by the Head of the Denpasar District Prosecutor's Office and by the Deputy Head of the General Crimes Directorate from the INP District Office in Bali.  The timing of this workshop is pertinent because Bali will host the International G20 Summit in November 2022, an event expected to generate a sharp increase in human sex trafficking.  This event was delivered with support of and in coordination with the State Department’s Bureau of Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL). #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     MARTIN ESTRADA SWORN IN AS UNITED STATES ATTORNEY      On September 19, Martin Estrada was sworn in as the United States Attorney for the Central District of California by Chief United States District Judge Philip S. Gutierrez. After being confirmed by the United States Senate on September 13, Mr. Estrada was given a four-year appointment by President Joseph Biden. He is now the district’s chief law enforcement officer and oversees the largest United States Attorney’s Office outside of Washington, D.C.

There, in addition to representing corporate clients, Estrada handled high-impact pro bono matters in the areas of education, immigration and equal justice. Mr. Estrada graduated with distinction from Stanford Law School and earned his undergraduate degree in history from the University of California, Irvine, where he graduated magna cum laude.

The guidance further explains how agencies should process requests involving Privacy Act records, depending on whether the request is submitted by a first-party requester seeking their own records or a third-party seeking records about another person.  The guidance also addresses other common questions, such as how to handle third-party information within a Privacy Act record and how to report requests involving Privacy Act records in agencies’ Annual FOIA Reports.The topics covered in this guidance are regularly included in OIP’s training on FOIA-Privacy Act Interface.  OIP is also available to answer any questions or provide additional guidance to agencies.  Please contact 202-514-3642 or DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov for assistance. #> 4 The FOIA requires agency Chief FOIA Officers to report to the Attorney General on their performance in implementing the law.  Accordingly, since 2009, the Department of Justice has directed agency Chief FOIA Officers to “review all aspects of their agencies’ FOIA administration” and to report annually to the Department of Justice on the efforts undertaken “to improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their agencies.”  Every year, OIP provides specific guidance to agencies on the content and timing of agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports and today we have issued the guidelines for agency 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports. In their 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports, OIP requires agencies to report steps taken in five key areas of FOIA administration highlighted in the Attorney General’s 2022 FOIA Guidelines:FOIA Leadership and Applying the Presumption of Openness,\\tEnsuring Fair and Effective FOIA Administration,\\tProactive Disclosures,\\tSteps Taken to Greater Utilize Technology; and\\tSteps Taken to Remove Barriers to Access, Improve Timeliness in Responding to Requests, and Reduce Backlogs.The 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Guidelines once again include separate reporting requirements for agencies depending on the number of FOIA requests received in the prior fiscal year.  For 2023, there are two sets of reporting requirements.  Agencies that received 50 requests or less in Fiscal Year 2021 are encouraged to report on any efforts or success stories that are not captured in their Fiscal Year 2022 Annual FOIA Report.  All other agencies receiving more than 50 requests have more extensive reporting requirements. OIP has identified 65 agencies that received more than 50 requests in Fiscal Year 2021. These agencies must submit their draft 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to OIP for review by no later than January 17, 2023.  For the remaining agencies receiving 50 requests or less in Fiscal Year 2021, if they do have information to report, they must provide their reports by no later than February 10, 2023.  A listing of all agencies with a link to their reporting requirements is included at the end of the Guidelines. Additional details on the review and submission process are included in the Guidelines.  OIP will once again host refresher training courses on the preparation of both the 2023 Chief FOIA Officer Reports and the Fiscal Year 2022 Annual FOIA Reports. #> 5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 On September 14, the ICITAP-Bangladesh mission reported on ICITAPs Counter-Wildlife Trafficking (CWT) program, which was honored to be joined on their recent wildlife prosecutions training event held in Sreemangal, Sylhet, Bangladesh by women law enforcement officers from across the Bangladesh Forest Department and Bangladesh Police. The Wildlife Crime Control Unit, Junior Wildlife Scout stated, “This workshop is helping me personally because seeing women speak in public to a large audience with so much confidence is inspiring and something I would like to achieve myself.” The Wildlife Inspector of the Wildlife Crime Control Unit, Bangladesh Forest Department when referring to the presence and participation of the visiting U.S. federal judge and the Assistant District Attorney at the ICITAP CWT event stated, “When I see (them), such successful women, I look at them in surprise and I am inspired to do something.” In yet another highlight, the Additional Superintendent of Police – also a participant at the event – reported to have also received previous support and assistance from the U.S. Government, becoming the first policewoman in Bangladesh to receive SWAT training in the United States. ICITAP’s CWT Program is managed with the support of and in coordination with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). #> 6                                                                                                                                        On September 13, ICITAP’s Assistant Director for ICITAP Women, Peace, and Security (WPS) announced that in July of 2022, the second iteration of the United States Government Women, Peace, and Security Congressional Report was released, showcasing key milestones from participating departments in the first implementation year of the WPS strategy. ICITAP’s Engaging Multinational Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) Program showcased as key implementer in the Department of State’s advancement of women’s recruitment, retention, and professional development in the justice and security sectors. The congressional report included key metrics and status reports from Department of State, Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security, and the United States Agency for International Development on key activities supporting the WPS strategy. In this report the CT-Funded ICITAP EMPoWER Program’s initiative to provide advanced leadership and tactical trainings for the Commander of the Kenyan All-Female SWAT Team (AFSWAT) during a week-long study tour was highlighted as a key activity in support of the first line of effort (LEO) in the WPS Strategy under the Department of State’s framework. The study tour is highlighted as an activity that supports the preparation and meaningful participation of women around the world in decision-making processes related to conflict and crises. The excerpt from the WPS Congressional Report is as follows: “CT hosted a Kenyan delegation to Washington as part of the “Engaging Multinational Policewomen [on Equality] and Rights” (EMPoWER) program, which is designed to promote the participation of women police in counterterrorism law enforcement efforts. During the week-long study tour, the commander of the Kenyan All-Female Special Weapons and Tactics (AFSWAT) Team, along with senior leadership of the Kenyan Administrative Policy, visited multiple U.S. law enforcement agencies to learn about improving recruitment, training, and mentorship of women police, and strengthening networking and mentorship opportunities.” ICITAP’s EMPoWER program builds the capacity of foreign counterterrorism law enforcement agencies and contributes to the advancement of women in leadership in the justice and security sectors. #>      changed    created

Public Information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and proceedings <\/p> <p>(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows: <\/p> <p>(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions; <\/p><p>(B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available; <\/p> <p>(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations; <\/p> <p>(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and <\/p> <p>(E) each amendment, revision or repeal of the foregoing. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof, a person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be adversely affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal Register and not so published. For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. <\/p><p>(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying-- <\/p><blockquote> <p>(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases[;], <em>if the final opinions or orders are cited, used, or relied on as precedent by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p>(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; and <\/p> <p>(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public; <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. To the extent required to prevent a<em>n<\/em> [clearly] unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction. However, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made available or published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency only if-- <\/p><blockquote>   <blockquote> <p>(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or <\/p> <p>(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <\/blockquote><p>(3)<em>(A)<\/em> Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request <em>by any United States person<\/em> for records which [(A)] <em>(i)<\/em> reasonably describes such records and [(B)] <em>(ii)<\/em> is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to [any person] <em>the requester.<\/em> <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) A requester shall not make or maintain a request under this paragraph for records relating to the subject matter of an  ongoing judicial or adjudicatory administrative proceeding (civil or criminal) to which the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in making the request, is a party <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) An agency may require by regulation that each request for records under this section include declarations by the requester that the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in  making the request, is: <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a United States person as defined in this section, and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) not barred by subsection (a) (3) (B) from making the request. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>A request that does not comply with any such regulation requirement is not a proper request under this section. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(4) (A) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying a uniform schedule of fees applicable to all constituent units of such agency. <em>The schedule may provide for the payment of all costs reasonably attributable to responding to the request, including the costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.<\/em> [Such fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication and provide for recovery of only the direct costs of such search and duplication.] <em>If the requested records contain commercially valuable technological or reference information, generated or acquired by the government at substantial cost to the public, fees may be charged which reflect the fair market value or royalties or both, in addition to or in lieu of any processing fees otherwise chargeable, taking into account such factors as the estimated commercial value of the information, its cost to the government, and any public interest served by its disclosure<\/em>. Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where the agency determines, <em>in the exercise of its discretion,<\/em> that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. <\/p><blockquote> <p><em>(B) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying  procedures by which--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) a submitter may be required to designate, at the time of submission, any information consisting of trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information, which is exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4);<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency shall notify the submitter that a request has been made for information provided by the submitter within a reasonable time prior to a decision to release any such information;<\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the submitter may, within 10 working day of the forwarding of such notification, submit to the agency written objection to such disclosure specifying all grounds upon which it is contended that the information should not be disclosed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the agency shall notify the submitter of any final decision to release such information.<\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(C) An agency is not required to notify a submitter pursuant to subparagraph (B) if-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) the information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with agency regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (4)(B)(i), if such designation is required by the agency; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) the agency determines, prior to giving such notice, that the request should be denied; <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iii) the disclosure is required by law (other than this section); or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(iv) the information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(D) If a submitter has objected pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), to disclosure of information that the agency determines to be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4), the agency shall not release such information unless the agency determines in writing that the failure to disclose the records would injure an overriding public interest and disclosure is not otherwise prohibited by law<\/em>. <\/p> <p>[(B)]<em> (E)<\/em> On complaint<em> filed by a requester within 90 days from the date of final agency action or by a submitter prior to the release of submitted information,<\/em> the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has jurisdiction--<\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i)<\/em> to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from [the complainant.] <em>the requester; or  <p>(ii) to enjoin the agency from any disclosure of records which was objected to by a submitter under subparagraph (B)(iii) or which would have been objected to had notice been given as required by subparagraph (B)(ii). <\/p><\/em> <\/p><\/blockquote> <p><em>(F) In an action based on a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) by a requester, the court shall have jurisdiction over any submitter of information <\/em> <em>contained in the requested records, and any such submitter may intervene as of right in the action; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) by a submitier, the court shall have jurisdiction over any requester of records containing information which the submitter seeks to have withheld, and any such requester may intervene as a matter of right in the action. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(G) The agency that is the subject of the complaint shall promptly, upon service of a complaint--<\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) seeking the production of records, notify each submitter of information contained in the requested records that the complaint was filed; and <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(ii) seeking the withholding of records, notify each requester of the records that the complaint was filed. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(H) In any action in which a requester is an intervenor or is joined the court shall on timely motion of the requester transfer the action to a district court which would have had jurisdiction had the action been brought by the requester, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown<\/em>. <\/p> <p><em>(I) In a case in which a record is withheld under subsection (b)(1), the court shall not enjoin the agency from withholding such record unless the agency's action is found to be arbitrary or capricious<\/em>. In [such a case] <em>all other cases<\/em>, the court shall determine the matter de novo [,]. [and] <em>The court<\/em> may examine the contents of [such] <em>requested<\/em> agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section [,].

The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies  of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employees or his representative. The  administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends. <\/p> <p>[(G)] <em>(N)<\/em> In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member. <\/p> <\/blockquote><p>(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member in every agency proceeding. <\/p><p>(6) (A) Each agency, upon request [for records] made under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection <em>for records which are sufficiently identified and limited that no more than eight working hours of search and review time are required to respond to the request, and which do not contain trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information provided by a submitter<\/em>, shall-- <\/p><blockquote><blockquote> <p>(i) determine within ten <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; and <\/p> <p>(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty <em>working<\/em> days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p>[(B) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of the subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days. As used in this subparagraph, \"unusual circumstances\" means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request-- <\/p> <blockquote> <p>(i) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; <\/p> <p>(ii) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or <\/p> <p>(iii) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.] <\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (A), each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection shall-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(i) within thirty working days after the receipt of the request-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) determine whether to comply with such request, in whole or in part, and immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the requester's right to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed one year; and <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote> <p><em>(ii) within thirty working days after the receipt of an appeal-- <\/em><\/p> <blockquote> <p><em>(a) make a determination of the appeal; or <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed six months. <\/em><\/p> <\/blockquote><\/blockquote> <p><em>If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the requester of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. <\/em><\/p> <p><em>(C) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying the time periods under subparagraph (B).

to amend the Freedom of Information Act continue on Capitol Hill. <\/p> <p>Major highlights of the efforts to amend the FOIA have been the presentation of the Administration's proposal (see pp. 3-8 of <em>FOIA Update<\/em>) by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan C. Rose of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, and subsequent hearings on this proposal (S. 1751/H.R. 4805) and on a similar proposal, S. 1730, Senator Orrin G. Hatch's FOIA reform bill. Senator Hatch is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Judiciary   Committee. The Hatch subcommittee has held six hearings on the need for FOIA reform.<\/p> <p>In presenting the Administration's proposal on Oct. 15, Assistant Attorney General Rose declared that the Administration stands \"fully committed to carrying out the philosophy and spirit of the Act.\" <\/p> <p>Rose told the Hatch subcommittee that the Administration is \"concerned that in some instances the Freedom of Information Act has been used in ways that are inconsistent with the original objectives of the Congress.\" These include efforts for disclosures which have \"interfered unduly with proper law enforcement activities and national security functions,\" Rose said. He also pointed to the considerable expense involved in FOIA processing and the diversion of agency resources from program responsibilities. <\/p> <p>The Office of Legal Policy began its comprehensive review of the need for FOIA reform in May of this year by asking federal agencies to comment on problems encountered in administering the FOIA and to recommend specific changes in the law. The Administration's legislative proposal represents a synthesis of these recommendations. <\/p> <p>The Administration's proposal includes two additional exemptions to the existing nine; clarification of several existing exemptions; modifications of provisions to allow for new time limits and fee assessments; additional procedures and protections for business information; and new provisions which would preclude use of the FOIA by persons other than U.S. citizens and by parties to lawsuits who have discovery rights. <\/p> <p>Substantive amendments to the current FOIA exemptions include: <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 1<\/strong>--The standard for judicial review with respect to classified records is proposed to be the \"arbitrary or capricious\" standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 2<\/strong>--The proposal extends confidentiality to manuals and instructions to investigators, inspectors, auditors and negotiators, and also to examination material used in employment, certification or licensing. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 4<\/strong>--The Administration's bill would enlarge the protection accorded business records by providing that such records are exempt if their release \"may impair either the legitimate competitive, financial, or business interests of any person or the government's ability to obtain such information in the future.\" In addition, the bill provides procedures by which submitters of such information may have input into agency disclosure determinations. Finally, courts deciding \"reverse FOIA\" cases would review agency disclosure decisions according to a <em>de novo<\/em> standard. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 6<\/strong>--The Administration's bill extends personal privacy protection to \"records or information concerning individuals\"; changes the balancing standard from a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" to an \"unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\"; and exempts compilations of names and addresses that could be used for solicitation purposes. <\/p> <p><strong>Exemption 7<\/strong>--The Administration's bill makes the following changes: broadening of the exemption's threshold language; addition of language to ensure that investigatory information related to ongoing investigations is fully protected; protection of information that would \"tend to\" disclose the identity of a confidential source; and modification of existing language to further protect confidential sources. <\/p> <p>The bill would also provide an exemption for material related to investigations of terrorism, organized crime or foreign counterintelligence, where designated by the Attorney General. <\/p> <p>Two additional exemptions would allow agencies to protect records generated in settlement of a legal action and technical data which may not be exported outside of the United States without agency approval. <\/p> <p>The bill also provides for two new standards for assessing fees. The first one authorizes fees for the full costs attributable to the processing of requested records. The second permits assessments which reflect the true value of valuable technological or reference information. <\/p> <p>On the problem of time limits, the administration proposal would retain the 10-day time limits for material which can be processed without complication in eight working hours or less. Agencies could take up to a year to respond to more complex or voluminous requests and requests where the interests of a submitter are involved, but would have to provide a specific time estimate and explanation within 10 working days of receipt. <\/p> <p>The Administration bill also addresses the problem of the use of FOIA for discovery purposes by prohibiting a party to a judicial or administrative proceeding from filing a FOIA request for records relating to he subject matter of the proceeding. <\/p> <p>Consideration of the Administration's package and of S. 1730 continued in the Senate Subcommittee on he Constitution during November.<\/p> <p>Rep. Glenn English, chairman of he House Subcommittee on Government Information and Individual Rights, also has held hearings on the Freedom of Information Act and has indicated that he will consider further hearings and markup of a bill after the Senate takes action. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #> 4

            <strong>FOIA Update <br />Vol. III, No. 1 <br />1981<\/strong>    <h2>Recordkeeping Procedures Examined<\/h2>  <p>With few exceptions, records in the physical possession of a federal agency are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. <\/p> <p>Agencies do not, however, have to retain indefinitely all records which are created by or submitted to them. Under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3102 and § 3103, agencies are required to establish records management programs which identify records that should be preserved and to plan for the storage and disposal of records having only temporary significance. <\/p> <p>It is estimated that only about five percent of government records, because of their administrative, legal, research or other value, become part of the permanent national collection. For a variety of reasons, many more records are retained for longer periods of time than are required. <\/p> <p>In addition, some materials can be returned to submitters in the private sector, because of the circumstances under which they were obtained, once there is no longer a need for them. Agencies should be aware that once a Freedom of Information Act request has been received, the requested records assume a special status and ordinarily must be retained until the requester's access rights are determined. <\/p> <p>Federal records, generally speaking, fall into two categories: administrative materials which are standard throughout the entire government and for which there is a schedule for retention and disposition furnished by the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), and other materials which are related to the kinds of programs conducted by the individual agencies. Individual schedules for retention and final disposition of records are developed by agency personnel in consultation with the Archivist of the United States. <\/p>    <strong>The Justice Effort <\/strong>  <p>At the Justice Department, there is a full scale effort underway to help managers and clerical workers focus on files maintenance and records disposition practices. Under the guidance of Bernie Berglind of the Justice Management Division's Records and Publications Staff, a course in files maintenance and records disposition will be given five times in 1982, beginning with a class Jan. 5-6. <\/p> <p>In the course, Berglind points out that almost every move made in government generates paperwork. Some of this material--for example, reading files, informational copies and acknowledgments--need not be kept. Other routine material need not be kept for as long as some offices may keep it. In fact, a significant portion is covered by the routine retention and disposal schedule. <\/p>    <strong>At the FAA <\/strong>  <p>Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reviewed a great deal of material in the complex process of certifying the airworthiness of airplanes and the safety of parts and modifications. <\/p> <p>At first, the FAA took the position that this material -- called Type Design    Data -- was the sort of \"agency records\" required to be retained.    Although this information was generally thought to be in large part protected    under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, it was often sought by tort litigants involved    in suits against both large and small manufacturers. \"A classic use of    the FOIA in place of discovery,\" notes John Walsh, chief of the General    Law Branch, FAA. <\/p> <p>Then came two Supreme Court decisions clarifying what constitutes an \"agency record\" under the FOIA. \"Two recent Supreme Court decisions establish that the Government has no obligation, and perhaps no right, to consider manufacturers' technical data not in its possession to be agency records covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.<em> Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press<\/em>, 445 U.S. 136 (1980); <em>Forsham v. Harris<\/em>, 445 U.S. 169 (1980),\" Walsh noted in a memo. <\/p> <p>He then concluded that technical data which \"never physically reaches FAA premises because it is examined by designees of the Administrator is not 'obtained' by the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA.\" <\/p> <p>Further, \"technical data which has been returned by the FAA to the manufacturer before a FOIA request for it is received, because the FAA has no current need for it, is not in the possession or control of the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA . . .\"<\/p> <p>The FAA's new policy includes an agreement with the manufacturers that secures the records should a court disagree with agency policy or should there be some question as to the business future of a manufacturer. <\/p>    <strong>The Antitrust Division <\/strong>  <p>The Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission follow similar procedures related to return of materials. <\/p> <p>At the Antitrust Division, there is a long-standing practice of returning documents submitted in response to a grand jury subpoena or a civil investigative demand, once the investigation is completed. Rules for limiting the retention of these documents are spelled out in a Division Directive dated Dec. 18, 1980. <\/p> <p>For case law authorizing the practice of returning subpoenaed documents see <em>Application of Bendix Aviation Corp.<\/em>, 58 F. Supp. 953 (S.D.N.Y. 1945), and <em>In re Petroleum Industry Investigation<\/em>, 152 F. Supp. 646 (E.D. Va. 1957). <\/p> <p>At the FTC, Jack Schwartz, deputy assistant general counsel, said that the 96th Congress, apparently noting that DOJ's practices seemed to be working, \"in essence required the FTC to adopt a formal practice\" of returning original documents to submitters. The FTC would keep copies, only as needed, Schwartz says. The FTC regulation, adopted in accord with P.L. 96-252, states that \"[A]ny person who has submitted documentary material to the Commission may file a written request for the return of original documents which have not been received into evidence (1) after the close of the proceeding in connection with which the documents were submitted, or (2) when no proceeding in which the material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time . . .\"<\/p> <p>In sum, the timely application of destruction schedules and other record disposition techniques can result in superior records management and less costly FOIA searches.

<br /><\/p><p> <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Worthington Compressors, Inc., et al. v. Costle<\/em>, Nos. 80-1010, 80-1011, 80-1012, 80-1013 (D.C. Cir., Aug. 20, 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in this case expanded the availability of FOIA Exemption 4 by identifying a new factor to be considered when determining if submitted business material is confidential. <\/p> <p>Four manufacturers of portable air compressors who submitted reports on their    products to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were the appellants in    this case. They requested confidential treatment for their information, but    the agency rejected their objections to disclosure on the grounds that the information    could be duplicated by anyone with access to the air compressors through \"reverse    engineering.\" The manufacturers then sought to enjoin release in the district    court. They contended that the information constituted confidential commercial    information and should be withheld under Exemption 4. Further, they alleged    that the reverse engineering which could be undertaken to determine the design    and engineering specifications of their compressors would be so expensive as    to be commercially impracticable. The district court below sustained the agency    and ordered disclosure. <\/p> <p>The court of appeals, however, reversed. In determining whether information    is confidential in Exemption 4 cases, the circuit court said it is proper to    determine \"whether release of the requested information, given its commercial    value to competitors and the cost of acquiring it through other means, will    cause substantial competitive harm to the business that submitted it.\"    Accordingly, the court concluded, consideration should be given to how costly    it would be for a possible competitor to obtain the information through means    other than the FOIA and whether FOIA disclosure would constitute a windfall    to the requester. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <strong><em>Bast v. U.S. Department of Justice<\/em>, Nos. 79-2039, 80-1050    (D.C. Cir., Sept. 10, 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>This case grew out of a hearing in a previous case. Richard Bast, a private    investigator, alleged that U.S. District Judge John Pratt improperly induced    a court reporter to expunge a portion of a hearing transcript in the earlier    case. Bast then requested access to all FBI documents compiled during the investigation    into the allegation. After the FBI released approximately 600 pages of such    documents, Bast brought suit challenging all withholdings. With a few exceptions,    the district court agreed that the remaining documents were exempt from disclosure.  <\/p> <p>On appeal, 12 documents remained at issue. The agency asserted that all of    the withheld material fell within Exemption 7(C) -- the investigatory records    exemption relating to personal privacy. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said    that while Exemption 7(C) affords broad privacy rights to \"suspects, witnesses    and investigators,\" there still must be a case-by-case balancing of privacy    rights against the public interest in disclosure. <\/p> <p>After reviewing the documents <em>in camera<\/em> the court decided that, with    one exception, the privacy interest outweighed the public interest. The unique    exception is a three sentence passage containing comments by the judge which    the circuit court found could be interpreted as revealing a bias. \"The    public importance of judicial impartiality outweighs the privacy interest in    this case,\" the court ruled in ordering disclosure of that passage. A petition    for rehearing has been filed by the Department of Justice. <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p><strong><em>Brown v. Federal Bureau of Investigation<\/em>, 658 F.2d 71 (2d    Cir. 1981).<\/strong> <\/p> <p>In this case, a convicted kidnapper sought access to detailed information from    FBI files regarding his kidnaping victim. He argued that the victim had waived    her privacy rights by testifying at his trial and that, in any event, he had    an overriding need for the information in order to attack his conviction. The    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the requested information    was properly withheld under Exemption 6 and rejected the plaintiffs arguments.    After finding the requested information to be sufficiently personal to satisfy    the \"similar files\" threshold of Exemption 6, the court of appeals    held that the victim's testimony at the trial did not constitute a waiver of    \"her right to keep private other related matters.\" Most significantly,    the court of appeals found the plaintiff's stated interest in using such information    to obtain a new trial to be \"too uncertain, indirect, and remote\"    to overcome the victim's privacy interests in nondisclosure. (A somewhat contrary    outcome on this latter point was reached by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals    in<em> Ferri v. Bell<\/em>, published at 645 F.2d 1213, earlier this year, but    that decision was vacated on Oct. 23 by the Third Circuit and scheduled for    reargument.) <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p>  <\/p><p>   <em><\/em>   <strong><em>Radovich v. United States Attorney, District of Maryland<\/em>,    658 F.2d 957 (4th Cir. 1981). <\/strong> <\/p> <p>\"Confidential\" as used in the first clause of Exemption 7(D) does    not mean \"secret;\" rather, it means \"given in confidence\"    or \"in trust,\" the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit made clear    in this case. <\/p> <p>The court below had found that the information sought by the plaintiff in this    case was not protected because it was publicly known that the source had spoken    with government prosecutors. Accordingly, said the district court, the identity    of the source -- an attorney for an individual involved in the criminal investigation    -- was \"neither confidential nor at issue.\" In overruling the district    court, the circuit court of appeals concluded that the first clause of Exemption    7(D) serves to protect the attorney's conversations so long as the information    was given under an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances    where such an assurance could reasonably be assumed. Public knowledge of the    source's identity is irrelevant, the appellate court found. <\/p> <p>The Fourth Circuit also examined the second clause of Exemption 7(D), which    the district court has found likewise inapplicable, and construed it broadly    as well. The circuit court found that Congress intended to protect all of the    information furnished by a confidential source \"in the course of a criminal    investigation, irrespective of whether the information might have been available    from some other source.\" <\/p> <p>   <br /><\/p><p> Go to:  <a href=\"/oip/foi-upd.htm\">FOIA Update Home Page<\/a> <\/p> #>      changed    created       date teaser #> 1 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 2 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 3 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 4 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 5 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #> 6 2014-08-14 2014-08-14 1981-01-01   NULL #>                                                                                            title #> 1 FOIA Update: Text of Freedom of Information Act, Showing Changes Proposed in S. 1751/H.R. 4805 #> 2                                                    FOIA Update: OILP Publishes 1981  Case List #> 3                                                              FOIA Update: FOIA Reform Proposed #> 4                                                       FOIA Update: FOIA Training Opportunities #> 5                                                 FOIA Update: Recordkeeping Procedures Examined #> 6                                                         FOIA Update: Significant New Decisions #>                                                                                                                url #> 1 https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-text-freedom-information-act-showing-changes-proposed-s-1751hr-4805 #> 2                                       https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-oilp-publishes-1981-case-list #> 3                                                https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-reform-proposed #> 4                                      https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-foia-training-opportunities-62 #> 5                                   https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-recordkeeping-procedures-examined #> 6                                        https://www.justice.gov/oip/blog/foia-update-significant-new-decisions-55 #>                                   uuid                                vuuid #> 1 4c7090d2-3e8f-4cc7-8160-2e15a2814090 b5d3e433-c9d2-4e4f-acb2-c2e722852530 #> 2 860458cd-687f-4f47-b844-1cc27d90b430 82035722-4d22-44dc-86b9-3f8c981d2f40 #> 3 bb7edcc0-9bec-4215-a7f7-0120caf14238 db71aa8b-924b-461a-a544-ba5bc1844fb3 #> 4 e2d43e0d-99db-49fb-8ac9-87fa0e526e8d 8ed9c40a-ed7d-4463-affb-7c03f100037a #> 5 e7024fa1-22a1-49f0-80ae-5e563fcd94b3 cd549f68-a8b5-4d3a-9846-928bd48300db #> 6 cee7fff5-c6e2-405e-b047-1b318edfe166 2a4fb4f5-fadd-4ddb-8678-2b2fddb43126 #>                           name #> 1 Office of Information Policy #> 2 Office of Information Policy #> 3 Office of Information Policy #> 4 Office of Information Policy #> 5 Office of Information Policy #> 6 Office of Information Policy"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":null,"dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"accessing U.S. Department Justice (DOJ) open data press releases.","code":""},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"ref-usage","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Usage","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"","code":"doj_press_releases(     n_results = 50,     search_direction = \"DESC\",     keyword = NULL,     clean = TRUE   )"},{"path":"https://ropengov.github.io/usdoj/reference/doj_press_releases.html","id":"arguments","dir":"Reference","previous_headings":"","what":"Arguments","title":"Fetch U.S. DOJ Press Releases — doj_press_releases","text":"n_results number results return. default, 50 results returned. search_direction Set ASC DESC fetch data starting least recent entries. default, data sorted descending order (recent entries). keyword return results containing keyword.

                                       Dr. Sonjay Fonn and Ms. Deborah Seeger of Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and their professional companies, Midwest Neurosurgeons, LLC and DS Medical, LLC, have agreed to pay $825,000 to resolve a lawsuit alleging that they violated the False Claims Act by soliciting and receiving kickbacks from spinal implant companies.The Justice Department’s lawsuit alleged that Dr. Fonn, Ms. Seeger, Midwest Neurosurgeons, and DS Medical solicited and received remuneration from spinal implant companies in return for arranging for the use of those companies’ products in Dr. Fonn’s surgeries, in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. The Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits soliciting or receiving anything of value in return for the referral of items or services covered by federal health care programs. The statute is intended to ensure that medical providers’ judgments are not compromised by improper financial incentives.“The Anti-Kickback Statute plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity of medical care provided to federal health care program beneficiaries,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Treatment decisions should be determined by beneficiaries’ medical needs, not by kickbacks provided to their surgeon.”“This case took nearly a decade of hard work by my office, the whistleblowers, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, the FBI and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office,” said U.S. Attorney Sayler A. Fleming for the Eastern District of Missouri. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will always vigorously pursue anyone who fraudulently obtains taxpayer money and defrauds Medicare and Medicaid.”“Medical providers who accept kickbacks put personal financial gain before the needs of their patients. This behavior can harm patients and undermines the integrity of federal health care programs,” said acting Special Agent in Charge Linda Hanley of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG is proud to work alongside our federal and state partners to protect our programs from fraud and ensure that patient needs drive provider decisions.”The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Paul Cairns, Dr. Terry Cleaver, Dr. Kyle Colle, Dr. Scott Gibbs, Dr. Paul Tolentino, Dr. Kevin Vaught, and Daniel Henson. Under those provisions, a private party can file an action on behalf of the United States and receive a portion of any recovery. The share to be paid to the private parties has not yet been determined in this matter.The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, with assistance from the FBI, the HHS-OIG, and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Missouri Attorney General’s Office.The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.

Bates sentenced Alex Ogando to 12 years.  Olatunji Dawodu and Luis Spencer were previously sentenced to 12 years and 12 ½ years, respectively.  All three defendants were convicted of conspiracy to distribute 400 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing fentanyl.             The Darknet operations pumped kilograms of fentanyl pills into communities across the nation over the course of four years, using Darknet markets including AlphaBay, Dream, Wall Street, and Empire to reach a broad customer base.  The defendants also used encrypted messaging services to communicate with and sell pills directly to customers.  In exchange for cryptocurrency, the defendants sold fentanyl pills that were shipped via the U.S. Postal Service to buyers in the District of Columbia and all 50 states.  The conspiracies relied on sophisticated technology to distribute and profit from a staggering quantity of pills pressed with fentanyl.            The case was prosecuted by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Crane and Assistant U.S. Attorney Connor Mullin.  The investigation was conducted by the FBI’s Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force, which is composed of FBI agents, analysts, and task force partners, including special agents and officers of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, DEA, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and detectives from local assisting police agencies. Additional assistance was provided by the United States Attorney’s Offices for the District of Rhode Island and the Southern District of Florida, the FBI’s Miami and Boston Field Offices, and the IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit. #> 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, announced today that AMIT BHARDWAJ, the former Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) at Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“Lumentum”), pled guilty to 13 counts arising from his participation in a scheme to commit insider trading based on material, non-public information (“MNPI”) that BHARDWAJ misappropriated from his employer, Lumentum.  BHARDWAJ traded on the misappropriated MNPI himself and tipped his associates with this same information so that they could place profitable trades in Lumentum’s acquisition targets. BHARDWAJ was arrested and charged in July 2022 and pled guilty earlier today before U.S. District Judge Gregory H. Woods.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Amit Bhardwaj, the former Chief Information Security Officer of Lumentum, ironically failed to keep the confidential information he was trusted with secure as he shared it with numerous friends and a family member in order to make a profit.  Not only did Bhardwaj betray his company and cheat the securities markets, but when confronted by the FBI, he also schemed to conceal his illicit behavior and obstruct the investigation.  Today’s guilty plea emphasizes this Office’s commitment to protecting the integrity of the financial markets.”According to the allegations in the Indictment and statements made in public court proceedings:In approximately December 2020, BHARDWAJ learned that Lumentum was considering acquiring Coherent, Inc (“Coherent”).  Based on this information, BHARDWAJ himself purchased Coherent stock and call options, and BHARDWAJ tipped three associates –– his friend Dhirenkumar Patel, another friend, and one of BHARDWAJ’s close family relatives ––and these individuals all traded in Coherent securities as a result.  BHARDWAJ and Patel agreed that Patel would pay BHARDWAJ 50% of the profits that Patel earned by trading in Coherent based on the MNPI provided by BHARDWAJ.  When Coherent’s stock price increased substantially following the announcement of the Lumentum acquisition, BHARDWAJ, his close family member, his friend Patel, and another friend closed their positions in Coherent securities and collectively profited by nearly $900,000.In or about October 2021, BHARDWAJ learned that Lumentum was engaged in confidential discussions with Neophotonics Corporation (“Neophotonics”) about a potential acquisition.  BHARDWAJ provided this information to SRINIVASA KAKKERA, ABBAS SAEEDI, and Ramesh Chitor, and these individuals all traded in Neophotonics securities as a result.  In connection with Chitor’s trading, BHARDWAJ and Chitor agreed that Chitor and BHARDWAJ would split the profits equally.  When Neophotonics’ stock price increased substantially following the announcement of the Lumentum acquisition in November 2021, KAKKERA, SAEEDI, and Chitor closed their positions in Neophotonics securities and made collectively approximately $4.3 million in realized and unrealized profits.After they were interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) voluntarily and served with federal grand jury subpoenas on approximately March 29, 2022, BHARDWAJ took steps to obstruct the federal investigation of their conduct.  On the day of the March 29, 2022, FBI interviews, BHARDWAJ drove to the homes of certain of his co-conspirators to encourage them not to tell the federal authorities the truth about their insider trading scheme.  BHARDWAJ and his associates subsequently met in person on multiple occasions and discussed, among other things, potential false stories that would conceal their insider trading scheme as well as creating false documents to buttress lies regarding payments that were, in reality, related to the insider trading scheme.*                *                *BHARDWAJ, 49, of San Ramon, California, pled guilty to seven counts of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison, and four counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum term of five years in prison. The statutory maximum sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.  BHARDWAJ is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Woods on July 11, 2023, at 10 a.m.Mr. Williams praised the investigative work of the FBI.  He also acknowledged the assistance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which separately initiated civil proceedings against BHARDWAJ.This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Noah Solowiejczyk and Adam Hobson are in charge of the prosecution. #> 4

conspiring to distribute fentanyl, United States Attorney Jane E. Young announced today.            According to court documents and statements made in court, Canario-Batista was part of a drug-distribution conspiracy operating in Lawrence, Massachusetts that distributed fentanyl into New Hampshire. The defendant provided a stash house for fentanyl imported from an international source of supply and assisted in distributing the fentanyl to other larger distributors.  The defendant was intercepted on a court authorized wiretap arranging drug purchases from a co-conspirator who was importing the drugs. The interceptions and other evidence resulted in the execution of a search warrant at the defendant’s residence which resulted in the seizure of over 7 kilograms of fentanyl.            “This is another example of the many people needed to make an international drug conspiracy function” said U.S. Attorney Young.  “The defendant operated a critical way station as the dangerous fentanyl traveled from its international source to the New Hampshire streets. We will continue to investigate and prosecute those involved at every level of moving this dangerous drug.”            “DEA is committed to investigating and dismantling Drug Trafficking Organizations and individuals like Mr. Batista who are responsible for distributing lethal drugs like fentanyl to the citizens of New Hampshire,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Brian D. Boyle.  “Today’s substantial sentence not only holds Mr. Batista accountable for his crimes but serves as a warning to those traffickers who are fueling the opioid epidemic with deadly drugs in order to profit and destroy people’s lives.  DEA’s top priority is combatting the opioid epidemic by working with our local, county, state and federal partners to bring to justice anyone who distributes this poison.”            “Canario-Batista played an important role in the supply chain that brings deadly opiates like fentanyl into our communities. International drug trafficking is an incredibly complex problem that can only be addressed through collaboration and we are proud to join our partners with the Drug Enforcement Administration as we work together for results like today’s sentence,” said Michael Krol, Acting Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England.            This matter was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Seth Aframe, John Kennedy and Heather Cherniske.### #> 5 A former prison warden was sentenced today in the Northern District of California to 70 months in prison, 15 years of supervised release and $15,000 in restitution for sexually abusive conduct against three female victims who were serving prison sentences and one count of making false statements to government agents.Ray J. Garcia, 55, of Merced, California, was sentenced following his conviction by a federal jury in December 2022. Trial evidence showed that Garcia was employed as an associate warden and later as the warden of the Federal Correctional Institute in Dublin, California (FCI Dublin), an all-female low security federal correctional institution. All three of Garcia’s victims were incarcerated and serving their prison sentences at FCI Dublin under the custodial, supervisory and disciplinary authority of Garcia when the crimes occurred.“The defendant in this case abused his authority as a warden and violated his oath to protect those in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “The sentence he received today is another step forward in our ongoing efforts to root out sexual misconduct within the BOP. This prosecution should serve as both warning and reassurance that the Department of Justice will not waver in holding accountable BOP employees and executives who abuse their authority — whether they be a correctional officer, chaplain, or warden — and in pursuing justice for their victims.”“Rather than ensuring that female inmates at the Dublin prison were safe and secure, Garcia used his position as warden to sexually abuse three inmates over multiple years, intimidated inmates and lied to cover up his crimes, and created a heinous culture that failed to protect female inmates from widespread sexual abuse and violence at the hands of other Dublin employees. The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General will continue to aggressively investigate this type of egregious criminal conduct and we will do everything within our authority to bring perpetrators to justice,” said Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz.“Corrections officials are sworn to protect people and preserve civil rights — the extreme opposite of this defendant's heinous actions,” said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. “Garcia assaulted and harmed those in his care and custody, attempted to intimidate them into silence, and then lied in an effort to cover up his crimes. The FBI is grateful to the brave women who came forward to report these vile offenses, and we hope today’s sentence is one more step towards justice and healing.”“The evidence in this case paints a disturbing picture of a former warden who abused the trust placed in him, as well as authority granted to him, all while thinking he could get away with his crimes by lying to investigators and intimidating his victims,” said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. “Today’s sentence demonstrates that prison walls present no impediment to justice. The Department of Justice will hold accountable any prison official who violates their duty to protect those in federal custody.”The trial evidence established that Garcia abused inmates from December 2019 until July 2021. Garcia’s sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact against Victim 1 began in December 2019 and extended through March 2020, the abuse of Victim 2 occurred January to July 2021 and the abuse of Victim 3 occurred during the period of March to September 2020. The jury convicted Garcia of three counts sexual abuse and one count of sexually abusive contact as to Victim 1, two counts of abusive sexual contact as to Victim 2, and one count of abusive sexual contact as to Victim 3.The government’s sentencing memorandum described how Garcia also sought to deter his victims from coming forward. For example, Garcia told his victims he was friends with the person in charge of investigating sexual abuse of inmates, boasted that he could “never be fired,” and warned them that he worked for “Washington, D.C.” Garcia also instructed a victim to “get rid of any evidence” and reported falsely to another victim that a different inmate was sent back to FCI Dublin after pictures of a correctional officer were found on her phone. According to the government’s memorandum, Garcia created and perpetuated a culture of abuse. The government also pointed out that four other correctional officers at FCI Dublin have been charged with sexually abusing inmates while Garcia was associate warden or warden. The trial evidence also demonstrated Garcia made false statements to federal investigators. On July 22, 2021, Garcia was interviewed and told investigators he never asked inmates to be undressed for him and that he had never touched an inmate inappropriately. Trial evidence showed that Garcia had already asked multiple inmates to undress for him and had also touched Victim 1, Victim 2 and Victim 3 in a sexual manner.Garcia was initially charged with sexual abuse of an inmate on Sept. 24, 2021. A federal grand jury issued a superseding indictment on Aug. 23, 2022, charging Garcia with three counts of sexual abuse and four counts of abusive sexual contact against three female inmates. The superseding indictment also charged Garcia with one count of making false statements to a government agency during the investigation of the criminal acts. On Dec. 8, 2022, a jury convicted Garcia of all counts.Judge Gonzalez Rogers ordered Garcia to report to surrender on or before May 19 to begin serving his prison term.The Justice Department Office of Inspector General and the FBI are investigating the case, with the cooperation of the Bureau of Prisons.Assistant U.S. Attorneys Molly Priedeman and Andrew Paulson for the Northern District of California, with the assistance of Madeline Wachs, Leeya Kekona and Sara Slattery are prosecuting the case. #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           A federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, held on March 20 that Jeffrey Cadet violated a permanent injunction entered against him on Aug. 12, 2019, which barred him from acting as a federal tax return preparer or requesting, assisting in, or directing the preparation or filing of federal tax returns for others.On Jan. 5, 2022, following an investigation of Cadet’s activities, the United States filed a Motion for Order to Show Cause asking the court to hold Cadet in civil contempt based on evidence that he was preparing tax returns without signing them as the return preparer. The investigation was undertaken by the Tax Division as part of its effort to monitor the conduct of return preparers who have been enjoined from preparing returns for others, and to hold accountable those who violate their injunction.As the court noted, Cadet did not respond to the motion or contest the evidence against him. Based on the evidence presented by the United States, the court found that Cadet violated his injunction by continuing to prepare returns for customers and held him in civil contempt. To remedy his contempt, the court ordered Cadet to disgorge $24,410 in ill-gotten fees he received for conduct that violated the injunction. The court also ordered Cadet to pay the United States $7,386.39 to reimburse the government for the attorneys’ fees it incurred to investigate and prosecute his post-injunction conduct. The injunction barring Cadet from preparing tax returns remains in effect, and the United States remains authorized to monitor his compliance with the court’s orders.Deputy Assistant Attorney General David A. Hubbert of the Justice Department’s Tax Division made the announcement.Taxpayers seeking a return preparer should remain vigilant against unscrupulous tax preparers, including “ghost preparers” who don’t sign the returns they prepare. The IRS has information on its website for choosing a tax return preparer and has launched a free directory of federal tax preparers.

                             <p>  WASHINGTON   – A federal jury in Jacksonville, Fla., found Paul Tillis, a former Florida Department of Corrections officer, guilty on Jan. 16, 2009, of a felony federal civil rights violation for an August 2005 assault on an inmate.<\/p>    <p>  The evidence at trial showed that on Aug. 14, 2005, Tillis assaulted the victim by pouring a bottle of scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis was on duty as a supervisory corrections officer at the  Florida State Prison in Raiford. During his shift, one of the inmates in his custody allegedly feigned injury by lying on the floor of his cell. In response, the defendant filled a bottle from a nearby dispenser that provided water at near-boiling temperatures, then poured the scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis also failed to arrange for medical treatment for the victim, who suffered second degree burns on his chest as a result of this assault.<\/p>    <p>  \"It is important that corrections officers realize they may not use their positions of authority to inflict physical harm on inmates as punishment,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King for the Civil Rights Division. \"While the vast majority of law enforcement officers carry out their difficult duties in a lawful and professional manner, the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute those who cross the line and commit this type of unlawful act.\"<\/p>    <p>  Tillis faces a maximum punishment of ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez announced.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font pleaded guilty to devising and engaging in a scheme that deprived the people of Puerto Rico of his honest services as a legislator, performed free from conflict of interest, concealment and improper influence. De Castro Font also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion through fear of economic harm and under color of official right. De Castro Font was indicted for these and other related offenses on Oct. 2, 2008.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Francisco Augusto Besosa in the District of Puerto Rico. De Castro Font admitted that from Jan. 2, 2005, through August 2008, he directly and indirectly solicited between approximately $500,000 and $525,000 in cash payments and other benefits, such as campaign contributions in excess of the legal limits, lodging, private flights, meals and other things of value, from individuals. De Castro Font admitted that he engaged in official acts on behalf of some of these individuals who had provided him with these undisclosed benefits, including but not limited to, proposing legislation, preventing legislative projects to be voted or acted upon, and persuading other legislators to vote for or against legislation.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>De Castro Font also admitted to participating in a conspiracy to obtain cash and other benefits from five individuals whom he admitted he knew felt that if they did not provide him with the financial benefits requested, De Castro Font could use his official position to harm their financial interests.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Judge Besosa scheduled a sentencing hearing on Apr. 23, 2009.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Using an elected office for personal gain denies citizens the honest services of their elected leaders,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin. \"The Department will continue to identify and prosecute public officials who corruptly use their position and influence to illegally benefit themselves.\"<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Senator De Castro Font has accepted responsibility for the acts of public corruption charged in the indictment. His conduct was an affront to the voters of Puerto Rico who placed their trust and confidence in him and the institution that he represented, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. His blatant disregard for his oath of office and his breach of the public trust, for his personal enrichment, violated the very essence of our democratic government. We will continue our public corruption investigations against public officials and those who make illegal payments in exchange for official acts,\" said U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>\"Let this conviction send a stark message to all public servants that the sale of influence and public corruption will not be tolerated by the FBI or the law-abiding citizens of Puerto Rico,\" said Luis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI-San Juan Field Office.  \"The FBI will continue to be vigilant so as to root out all public corruption.  As I have said before, corruption affects every facet of society: the people, honest businessmen, education and public works.\"<\/p>\\n\\n<p>On Dec. 4, 2008, Alberto Goachet, a political consultant and aide to De Castro Font, pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to launder illegal campaign contributions and other payments.  Goachet admitted that he and others laundered the money through the use of fake invoices purporting to reflect legitimate payments to a political consulting firm owned by Goachet. Goachet admitted that the false invoices were meant to conceal a businessman’s illegal payments to De Castro Font. Goachet also admitted that in August 2008 he falsely claimed in an interview with the FBI that the invoices were legitimately written for services rendered to the businessman and denied that the money was intended for De Castro Font.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacqueline Novas and Timothy R. Henwood of the District of Puerto Rico, and Trial Attorney Matthew L. Stennes of the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section.

Breuer de la División de lo Penal; el Fiscal Federal Wifredo A. Ferrer del Distrito Sur de Florida; y Daniel W. Auer, Agente Especial a Cargo del Servicio de Impuestos Internos, Oficina Local de Miami de Investigaciones Penales (IRS-CI).<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Antonio Perez, 52, de Miami, también fue condenado por el Juez Federal de Distrito Jose E. Martinez a dos años de libertad bajo supervisión después de haber cumplido su sentencia en prisión, y a entregar $36,375 al gobierno. Perez se declaró culpable el 27 de abril de 2009, de conspirar para realizar pagos corruptos para una compañía de telecomunicaciones del Condado de Miami-Dade a funcionarios de la compañía de telecomunicaciones estatal de la República de Haití, Telecommunications D'Haiti, en violación de la Ley de Prácticas Corruptas en el Extranjero (FCPA) y leyes de lavado de dinero.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>En su declaración de culpabilidad, Perez admitió haber conspirado para realizar pagos corruptos a funcionarios gubernamentales extranjeros con la finalidad de obtener ventajas comerciales para la empresa de telecomunicaciones por parte de Telecommunications D'Haiti. De acuerdo con el expediente judicial, Perez conspiró con Robert Antoine, el ex director de relaciones internacionales para Telecommunications D'Haiti y Juan Diaz, el propietario de J.D. Locator Services, junto con otros. Perez y sus coconspiradores ocultaros los pagos de sobornos en parte al conducir transacciones financieras en las que se realizaron transferencias telegráficas de dinero a empresas fantasma y a través de denominaciones falsas en facturas, cheques y libros contables. Perez admitió que él mismo estuvo involucrado en dos pagos de sobornos por un total de aproximadamente 36,375 dólares.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>El 30 de julio de 2010, Diaz fue sentenciado a 57 meses en prisión después de haberse declarado culpable de pagar y ocultar 1,028,851 dólares en sobornos a ex funcionarios del gobierno de Haití mientras actuaba como intermediario para tres empresas privadas de telecomunicaciones. Antoine admitió que aceptó los sobornos, incluidos sobornos de Diaz, y se declaró culpable el 12 de marzo de 2010 a conspiración para cometer lavado de dinero. Antoine fue sentenciado a cuatro años en prisión.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Joel Esquenazi y Carlos Rodriguez, los propietarios de la empresa de telecomunicaciones en la que trabajaba Perez, así como Jean Rene Duperval, quien fue director de relaciones internacionales de Telecommunications D´'Haiti de junio de 2003 a abril de 2004, y la hermana de Duperval, Marguerite Grandison, fueron acusados formalmente junto con Antoine, el 4 de diciembre de 2009. El enjuiciamiento de los demás demandados tiene su inicio programado para el 28 de febrero de 2011 en el Tribunal Federal de Distrito en Miami. Una acusación formal es apenas una acusación, y se supone que los demandados son inocentes hasta que se pruebe lo contrario más allá de la duda razonable.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>El Departamento de Justicia agradece al gobierno de Haití por su importante asistencia en recabar pruebas durante esta investigación. En particular, la unidad de inteligencia financiera de Haiti, la Unite Centrale de Renseignements Financiers, el Bureau des Affaires Financieres et Economiques, el cual es un componente especializado de la Policía Nacional Haitiana, y el Ministerio de Justicia y Seguridad Pública brindar importante cooperación y coordinación en la investigación.<\/p>\\n\\n<p>Están a cargo de la acusación en el caso la Fiscal Federal Auxiliar Aurora Fagan de la Fiscalía Federal para el Distrito Sur de Florida, la Abogada Litigante Sénior Nicola J.

EL AL, an Israeli company, has agreed to pay a criminal fine of $15.7 million.<\/p>    <p>  Including today’s charges, a total of 12 airlines and three executives have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in the Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into price fixing in the air transportation industry. To date, more than $1 billion in criminal fines have been imposed and executives have been sentenced to serve a total of 20 months in jail.<\/p>    <p>  According to the charges filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, each airline engaged in a conspiracy in the United States and elsewhere to eliminate competition by fixing the cargo rates charged to customers for international air shipments, including to and from the United States. LAN Cargo and ABSA are charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about February 2003 and continuing until at least Feb. 14, 2006. EL AL is charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about January 2003 until at least Feb. 14, 2006. The plea agreements are subject to court approval. Each airline has agreed to cooperate with the Department’s ongoing investigation.<\/p>    <p>  \"American consumers were forced to pay higher prices on the goods they buy every day as a result of the inflated and collusive shipping rates charged by these companies,\" said Scott D. Hammond, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Antitrust Division.<\/p>    <p>  LAN Cargo, ABSA and EL AL are charged with carrying out the price-fixing conspiracy with co-conspirators by:<\/p>  <ul><li>Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere to discuss the cargo rates to be charged on certain routes to and from the United States;<\/li>  <li>Agreeing, during those meetings, conversations and communications on certain components of the cargo rates to charge for shipments on certain routes to and from the United States; <\/li>  <li>Levying cargo rates in the United States and elsewhere in accordance with the agreements reached; and<\/li>  <li>Engaging in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon cargo rates.<\/li>  <\/ul><p>  The nine airlines that have pleaded guilty to date as a result of the Department’s ongoing investigation into the air transportation industry are: British Airways Plc (British Airways), Korean Air Lines Ltd., Qantas Airways Limited (Qantas), Japan Airlines International Co.

Grant, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office announced.<\/p>    <p>  William Cozzi, 51, pleaded guilty to a one-count information in U.S. District Court in Chicago, admitting he used excessive or unreasonable force while acting under color of law. Cozzi joined the Chicago Police Department in 1992 and was assigned to the 25<sup>th<\/sup> District at the time of the alleged incident. He was subsequently suspended from duty. Cozzi was indicted in April 2008 for depriving the victim of his civil rights.<\/p>    <p>  On Aug. 2, 2005, while performing his duties as a police officer, Cozzi admitted that he used a \"sap,\" a dangerous weapon similar to a blackjack, to repeatedly strike the victim who was handcuffed and shackled in a wheelchair at Norwegian American Hospital, resulting in bodily injury. At the time, the victim was awaiting treatment in the hospital emergency room after being stabbed in the shoulder.<\/p>    <p>  \"The defendant violated the public trust by abusing his law enforcement authority,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King.  \"This prosecution demonstrates that the Civil Rights Division is committed to aggressively prosecuting law enforcement officers who willfully use excessive force.\"<\/p>    <p>  \"No law enforcement officer may use unreasonable force with impunity and every citizen, regardless of being in police custody, has a constitutional right to be free from the use of excessive force,\" U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald said.<\/p>    <p>  Cozzi pleaded guilty while reserving his right to appeal a ruling last year denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the prosecution was based in part on compelled statements he made to the Chicago Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards and during a police review board hearing.<\/p>    <p>  According to a plea agreement, Cozzi was dispatched to the hospital to respond to the stabbing and approached the victim who was being loud and verbally abusive while awaiting treatment for the stabbing. Shortly after approaching the victim, Cozzi placed him in handcuffs and left the emergency room to retrieve leg shackles, which he then placed on the victim. With the victim restrained, Cozzi used a sap to repeatedly strike him in the face and body. According to the plea agreement, at the time of the assault the victim posed no physical threat to Cozzi or anyone else at the hospital.<\/p>    <p>  Cozzi also admitted that he subsequently prepared a false arrest report and misdemeanor complaints stating that the victim attempted to punch him and two hospital security guards, as well as a false tactical response report stating that he used an \"open hand strike\" on the victim but omitted that he struck the victim with a sap.<\/p>    <p>  U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning set sentencing for March 26, 2009. Cozzi faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.<\/p>    <p>  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Drury from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.<\/p> #> 6   <p>  WASHINGTON – Phat Ngoc Tran, 35, pleaded guilty today in San Diego to conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, the \"Tran Organization,\" in a scheme to cheat at least 12 casinos across the United States and Canada out of millions of dollars, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen P. Hewitt for the Southern District of California announced today. Tran admitted that he and his co-conspirators unlawfully obtained up to $2.5 million during card cheats.<\/p>    <p>  A three-count indictment was returned May 22, 2007, and unsealed in the Southern District of California on May 24, 2007, charging Tran and 13 others each with one count of conspiracy to participate in the affairs of a racketeering enterprise; one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The indictment also charged five separate individuals each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.<\/p>    <p>  In his plea agreement, Tran admitted that on numerous occasions between approximately October 2002 and July 2006, he participated in gambling cheats together with other alleged members of the Tran Organization at casinos in the United States and Canada. Tran admitted to targeting at least 12 casinos in the racketeering conspiracy, including:<\/p>  <ul><li>Beau Rivage Casino, in Biloxi, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario, Canada;<\/li>  <li>Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn.;<\/li>  <li>Gold Strike Casino in Tunica, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino, in Bossier City, La.;<\/li>  <li>Horseshoe Casino and Hotel, in Tunica, Miss.;<\/li>  <li>Isle of Capri Casino, in Westlake, La.;<\/li>  <li>Majestic Star Casino, in Gary, Ind.;<\/li>  <li>Mohegan Sun Resort Casino, in Uncasville, Conn.;<\/li>  <li>Palace Station Casino, in Las Vegas, Nev.;<\/li>  <li>Resorts East Chicago Hotel and Casino, in East Chicago, Ind.; and <\/li>  <li>Sycuan Casino, in El Cajon, Calif.<\/li>  <\/ul><p>  According to the indictment, the defendants and others executed a \"false shuffle\" cheating scheme at casinos in the United States and Canada during blackjack and mini-baccarat games. The indictment alleges that members of the criminal organization bribed casino card dealers and supervisors to perform false shuffles during card games, thereby creating \"slugs\" or groups, of un-shuffled cards. The indictment also alleges that after tracking the order of cards dealt in a card game, a member of the organization would signal to the card dealer to perform a \"false shuffle,\" and members of the group would then bet on the known order of cards when the slug appeared on the table. By doing so, members of the conspiracy repeatedly won thousands of dollars during card games, including winning up to $868,000 on one occasion.<\/p>    <p>  The indictment also alleges that the members of the organization used sophisticated mechanisms for tracking the order of cards during games, including hidden transmitter devices and specially created software that would predict the order in which cards would reappear during mini-baccarat and blackjack games.<\/p>    <p>  An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.<\/p>    <p>  Tran’s sentencing is scheduled for June 1, 2009, in San Diego before U.S. District Judge John A. Houston. At sentencing, Tran faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the racketeering conspiracy charge.

DeliveredThank you, Kris, for that introduction and for your leadership, which is so powerful, always. I want to say good afternoon to all of you, to Members of Congress, including Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, and to my DOJ colleagues here and to other esteemed guests.As you all know, human trafficking, be it labor or sex trafficking, feeds on exploitation and often upon members of our communities who are already vulnerable, like unhoused youth, persons without lawful immigration status or those experiencing poverty. Data also suggest that while human trafficking impacts every racial and ethnic group in America, it disproportionately impacts Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color. Victims of human trafficking often face challenges in accessing trauma-informed and culturally responsive assistance and support and may encounter numerous obstacles when accessing justice or services. Human trafficking, with its complex and interlocking issues, demands the best of us and the best from us.It is imperative that we employ victim-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive approaches to this work. Over the years we’ve learned not just the value of this approach, but frankly, the consequence of its failure. Earning the trust of survivors is an important step in detecting trafficking in the first place. Building rapport and engaging with survivors is instrumental to removing barriers that can otherwise prevent survivors from coming forward, accessing services and from potentially participating as witnesses in successful investigations and prosecutions of human trafficking cases. And finally, continued and collaborative engagement with this process and people with lived experiences is fundamental to a holistic and enduring effort to build capacity to respond to human trafficking. Progress is not guaranteed. It is hard-fought, and it is earned by the hard work we — and especially all of you — put in day after day. You all move us towards progress.The Justice Department’s National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking reflects the department’s whole-of-agency approach to ensuring that victims of human trafficking are properly identified and receive the necessary support and services to heal and ultimately, to thrive.Our FBI Crimes Against Children and Human Trafficking Unit partners with a range of federal, state, local and Tribal authorities to identify and investigate these crimes.Our FBI Victim Services Division makes certain that identified victims understand their rights under the Victims Rights and Restitution Act and Crime Victims’ Rights Act and are provided critical services immediately following identification.Our specialized prosecutors in the Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section work with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide to strategically and compassionately prosecute these cases.Our Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section helps recover traffickers’ ill-gotten gains and ensure that survivors receive the mandatory restitution they’re entitled to. They also build affirmative cases against traffickers by identifying money flows and related financial investigative steps to identify the traffickers’ financial networks with a particular focus on money laundering charges.Our Office of Justice Programs provide grants, training, technical assistance, research, statistics, and other resources to improve our capacity to respond to human trafficking.And as you just heard from Kris in her welcome remarks, OVC in particular is spearheading our grant making efforts, making it possible for communities to better serve trafficking survivors.Our Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) funds community-based efforts to address the needs of children and youth victims of sex trafficking. OVW also provides funding to support prevention, intervention, and response activities, including culturally specific supportive services for American Indian and Alaska Native victims of sex trafficking. I am so proud of the work and the progress this department has made and of the transformations in the anti-trafficking field, including many spearheaded by the Office for Victims of Crime.Over the past two decades, the funding and resources provided by OVC to grantees and partners throughout the nation has grown exponentially, as Congress has recognized the vital importance of expanding access to comprehensive victim services. Currently, OVC manages an unprecedented number of anti-trafficking projects and grants, working with an exceptional range of organizations — many of whom are represented actually in this room today — who are providing services to a record number of victims and survivors of human trafficking. The performance data OVC grantees report tells the story of the incredible volume of case management, housing, legal, employment, supportive and mental health services that they have provided. In the most recent reporting period, between July 2021 and June 2022, grantees reported assisting well over 16,000 individuals across the country. That’s a record-high number that reflects both the enormous impact of this funding but really illustrates a mere fraction of the harm that trafficking causes.  So, as everyone has said before me, while we have much to celebrate, we remember and use today to remember that still so much more must be done for the most vulnerable among us. Knowing that you all are committed to doing this work with us a great hope because you are the best of us, and you will move us from progress to promise.  I now have the pleasure of introducing my colleague Kristen Clarke, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, whose lawyers and prosecutor and staff have bene hard at work tacking human trafficking. So, please join me in welcoming AAG Clarke to the podium. Thank you. #> 2

be here among you all today. Welcome to this anniversary commemoration to reflect on the department’s efforts to advance the nation’s response to human trafficking and for joining us in our enduring cause to help crime survivors find their justice.Thank you, Attorney General Garland, Associate Attorney General Gupta, Assistant Attorney General Clarke, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Solomon, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, colleagues, friends and fellow champions in our cause for joining us today.We observed Dr. King’s birthday earlier this month and it reminded me of his words.“We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always right to do right.”The Department of Justice, through its components, has built a multi-layered and robust response to the crime of human trafficking. Over the course of today’s program, you will hear about how DOJ, along with our federal partners, Congressional champions, stakeholders in the field, grantees and survivors of human trafficking have worked together over the past 20 years to ensure that survivors find healing and justice.OVC first started in the anti-trafficking field in 1998 when we awarded our very first grant with funding from the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA. It wasn’t a lot of money, and you could say what we knew about trafficking at that time wasn’t much more. But we knew there were survivors in need, and that grant provided a path to assist them and a path for OVC to learn.Two years later, with the passage of the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act, we were able to develop, expand, and strengthen services to reach more survivors. And before we knew it, Congress appropriated $10 million dollars to OVC in 2002, and we dug in. The following year, in 2003, we funded the first 12 programs under the Services for Trafficking Victims Discretionary grant program.These programs were comprehensive, inclusive of all victims and all forms of human trafficking, and flexible so that service providers could be responsive to a wide array of needs.This marked the beginning of a new chapter in OVC’s history and an enhanced focus within our organization. Our aim was to raise awareness, identify survivors and connect them to much-needed services. In 2010, OVC partnered with the Bureau of Justice Assistance to begin co-funding what’s known as the Enhanced Collaborative Model to Combat Human Trafficking. These multi-disciplinary task forces use a holistic approach to identify victims of trafficking, address their unique needs, and prosecute cases at the federal, Tribal, state, and local levels.Working with all our partners across the country, we were able to identify strong or promising practices which share in resources such as the Development and Operations Roadmap for Multidisciplinary Anti-Human Trafficking Task Forces;  the Faces of Human Trafficking online video series and most recently our anti-trafficking graphic novels written for young survivors of trafficking to help them navigate the judicial system.Today, all of the Office of Justice Programs’ law enforcement, juvenile justice and victim services human trafficking initiatives are housed within OVC; collaborating and modeling the multi-disciplinary approach we promote in our programs. And we’ve gone from $10 million in 2003 to this year awarding over $90 million in grant funding. Our grantees have gone from serving just over 5,000 clients in 2016 to today serving an unprecedented 16,000 clients based on our most recent reporting period. Our Human Trafficking Division, lead by Brecht Donoghue, and made up of nine dedicated professionals manages approximately 500 grant awards worth $360 million. I know I may be a bit biased, but I believe our Human Trafficking Division is one of the hardest working teams in OJP. I’d like to ask the Human Trafficking Division staff who are here with us today, to stand and be acknowledged.  Now, that is truly something to celebrate.Getting to where we are in our country’s efforts to end human trafficking took all of us. It took the loud voices, the quiet voices, the sometimes shaking but still strong voices. It took the brave voices of those who survived, and those who spoke for the ones who could no longer. Your voices have been lifted up and have shaped what we know today and will form what we learn tomorrow.It took the work of victim service providers and advocates who walked side-by-side with survivors and created programs to meet their needs, wherever they were. Adapting, collaborating, expanding and innovating to make sure no one was left behind but, more importantly, to make certain that everybody was included.It took the work of health care providers who understood the unique physical and mental health care needs these patients often required. Recognizing that providing culturally responsive, patient-centered care is a critical component to meeting survivors where they are.It took the work of dedicated law enforcement officers and prosecutors who were trained in trauma-informed techniques. Knowing that justice may look different for each survivor but that everyone deserves the same access to that justice.It took law makers and appropriators who were open to the idea that combatting and responding to human trafficking is not just a whole of government concept but a whole of society imperative. Appreciating that funding is the lifeblood of these efforts and getting it in the hands of the people doing the work is not only a matter of how, but how fast.As far as we’ve come, and as much as we are here to celebrate the good work that has been done; it’s clear, we have miles to go and work yet to do to end trafficking and provide pathways towards healing. It will take all of us, and it will take all we’ve got.That’s why today we have arranged for you to hear – quoting Dr. King again, the “passionate concern of dedicated individuals” from Department of Justice leadership to pioneers and innovators in the field, to individuals who’ve survived. They’re going to talk about our theme today: Collaboration, Transformation, and Impact, and they are going to talk about how the funding made possible by Congress for services, training and technical assistance, is critical to moving the needle for survivors of human trafficking across the country.With that, it is my distinct honor to introduce our first speaker today. Now, as Attorney General you can imagine there are a few issues that require your time and attention. When it comes to matters that impact people, when it comes to survivors of crime, this Attorney General understands the importance of his presence. This, no doubt, comes from his firsthand experience working with victims of crime as both an AUSA and as the lead prosecutor on the Oklahoma City bombing cases. When you hear him talk about our duty to serve crime victims, you know you are listening to a true champion for justice. We thank you for speaking with us today on this important topic on this important occasion.Distinguished guests, it’s my pleasure to introduce the 86th Attorney General of the United States Merrick Garland. #> 3

I am honored to join you in celebrating OVC’s tremendous achievements over the past two decades.Human trafficking is often described as a form of modern-day slavery because of the ways it degrades human dignity, erodes inalienable rights and subjects other human beings to a state of servitude. While slaveholders in the 18th and 19th centuries used whips, chains and physical restraints, contemporary trafficking crimes often rely on invisible schemes of deception, debts, threats and insidious forms of psychological manipulation to bind victims to perpetrators.  Traffickers target people of color, people who are experiencing homelessness or are facing substance abuse. They target those who are experiencing trauma from sexual or physical abuse, young people thrown out of their families for identifying as LGBTQ+. Traffickers manipulate individuals with cognitive disabilities, and they prey on persons with limited English proficiency or little access to education, or those who lack of immigration status, who are often unaware of the laws that protect them.Since the Civil Rights Division’s founding 65 years ago, enforcing these prohibitions against involuntary servitude have been a cornerstone of our mission as we’ve worked to uphold otherwise elusive Constitutional promises of freedom and equality. And after the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 expanded the statutory prohibitions and the tools available to the department, the division established a dedicated Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit to consolidate specialized anti-trafficking expertise. The unit has since been widely recognized, both nationally and globally, for advancing victim-centered, trauma-informed anti-trafficking strategies and for leading interagency enforcement initiatives to bring high-impact trafficking prosecutions, in partnership with our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide, in partnership with OVC and with other key anti-trafficking partners throughout the department and beyond. Just to underscore the urgency of this important work to bring traffickers to justice, earlier this week, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia sentenced three defendants to serve time in federal prison for conspiracy to commit forced labor for compelling the domestic labor of a Pakistani woman for 12 years. The defendants compelled the victim to serve the family as a domestic servant, using physical and verbal abuse, restricting her communication with her family back in her home country, confiscating her immigration documents, confiscating her money, threatening to separate her from her children by deporting her to Pakistan and more. They slapped, kicked and pushed the victim, even beat her with wooden board, and on one occasion hog-tied her hands and feet and dragged her down the stairs in front of her children. Last week, in an indictment that was unsealed in the Western District of Wisconsin, we charged a Wisconsin man with one count of labor trafficking for using force, threats of force and coercion to cause an adult woman to engage in forced labor for nearly two years.From the time of OVC’s formation, the division has worked hand-in-hand with OVC and other key partners to seek justice for human trafficking victims. Our work alongside OVC on behalf of trafficking victims and survivors is a natural extension of the division’s core mission of abolishing the legacy of slavery and servitude; upholding the Constitution; and vindicating the rights of the most vulnerable. As we emphasized many years ago when announcing the formation of the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit,“Since the inception of the Civil Rights Division, [it] has led the fight against crimes that perpetuate a legacy of slavery and servitude. Whether these crimes took the form of lynchings and cross-burnings by night, or compelled servitude and bondage by day, they all entrenched a legacy of oppression against vulnerable members of our society. Modern-day slavery has taken on new forms … but the struggle remains the same – to vindicate the rights of marginalized members of our society who would otherwise have no voice, and who would otherwise be denied the guarantees of freedom and liberty that form the core of our Constitution.”Our close collaboration with OVC reflects the recognition that the three pillars of global anti-trafficking efforts — protecting victims, prosecuting perpetrators and preventing proliferation — are inseparable from each other and are all essential to our fight against human trafficking. In order to bring traffickers to justice, we must provide victims the protections they need to safely come forward and speak out against their traffickers. And in order to provide victims and other vulnerable people meaningful protection from trafficking threats, we must not only provide them assistance as they work to reclaim and rebuild their lives; we must also hold the perpetrators accountable for their crimes and dismantle trafficking enterprises so they cannot revert to victimizing others.To give an example of what such accountability looks like, in December, a federal judge sentenced an Alabama trafficker to 60 years in prison and ordered him to pay almost a million dollars in restitution to five victims in a case prosecuted by the department. The trafficker targeted women struggling with substance abuse issues and preyed upon them by increasing their heroin use. Then the trafficker withheld opioids from the victims to induce extremely painful withdrawal sickness and compel them to engage in commercial sex. He beat the women and threatened to send sexually explicit images of them to their families. At trial, the victims testified courageously against the trafficker. The victims remain in recovery to this today, and they are now on the road to reclaiming their lives – thanks in part to the services and support they received. One now works for the organization that helped her, working to aid other victims. And that is the lasting impact of collaboration.So, this work requires strong partnerships, and OVC’s work in funding victim service providers and training task force partners has proven vital to identifying, stabilizing and supporting more survivors than ever before. OVC’s efforts, in collaboration with victim service grantees — including some who are here today — are essential to empowering survivors to speak out against their traffickers, often enabling them to testify as witnesses in criminal cases.In recent years, we’ve also worked closely with OVC to amplify the voices of survivors and incorporate the survivor expertise into our work and into ability to detect, investigate, and prosecute these cases. And we’re grateful for OVC’s role in expanding the ongoing dialogue among survivor-experts, victim specialists and law enforcement as we work to strengthen our collective anti-trafficking work.We know from experience that this collaboration has made a profound difference on victims’ lives. As one survivor said about the experience of working with the department and when writing her victim impact statement, “I thank God that there were noble people like you guys to see that justice is served and there to help us and value us, and thanks to you, I had the strength to write this statement.”We’re honored to take a part in this celebration of OVC, its work and its accomplishments over the past two decades and look forward to building on this partnership and continuing the fight in the road ahead as we work to pursue justice for victims and survivors of human trafficking.Thank you so much. #> 4 Remarks as Prepared for Delivery Thank you for that kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to be with you today.At the outset, let me congratulate you, Alden, and the staff of the Mercatus Center for putting together today’s program. You’ve brought together thoughtful antitrust lawyers and scholars for what is no doubt an interesting discussion about antitrust enforcement and competition policy.In preparation for today’s program, I took the opportunity to learn more about the Mercatus Center’s mission and work. Devoted to “market-oriented ideas,” its research focuses on “how markets solve problems.”[1]You might wonder then how—or even why—someone like me, a federal antitrust enforcer with an admittedly pro-enforcement outlook, finds herself at this sort of confab. But that is the wonderful thing about today’s program. Notwithstanding its worldview, the Center invites people of different viewpoints to share ideas and learning.For that, I commend you and thank you for bringing all of us together. In times of social, political, and economic polarization, candid conversations like this one are an especially important public good. That is also why I chose this event to give my first significant address as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Antitrust Division.I. IntroductionWe are so fortunate to practice in a time when debates about corporate power, antitrust enforcement, and the operation of markets enjoy such prominence in the public consciousness.These issues and debates, of course, are not new to us. But in the last several years, the discussions have spilled onto kitchen tables across the country, our social media feeds, and of course our news media of choice.Setting enforcement policy is a tremendous honor; with it comes tremendous responsibility, especially at a time when competition issues feature so prominently in our national dialogue. That is why drawing in a wide swath of viewpoints, including from those who live under the market structures and conditions that our enforcement and policy choices beget, is so important. That was the central thesis behind the agencies’ merger guidelines RFI process. Feedback sharpens our thinking, vets our assumptions, and, ultimately, leads to better considered policy judgments.In this vein, I acknowledge there is a lot on which we may not agree. But one of my core beliefs and governing principles is that more unites than divides us. And I think that’s particularly true when it comes to the axioms of competition policy.Let me explain.In my conversations, I sometimes hear two competing views about the role of corporations. These views loosely affiliate with different ends of the political spectrum, though not exclusively so. Some may view corporations as inherently greedy. Extractive corporations take from consumers and workers alike, entrenching their position by using power for harmful ends. Others don’t see that profit motive as a bad thing. They subscribe to Milton Friedman’s famous line that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.”[2] The invisible hand of the market, they say, transforms that self-promoting corporate conduct into something that benefits all of society.What strikes me about these competing views, though, is that they share a common prescription: the vast majority of people believe, or at least say they believe, in the value of competition. Whether you are skeptical about the power of government or of corporate power, you likely attach some value to the rivalry between firms, and the benefits that rivalry can produce. If you see corporate motives as suspect, competition keeps corporations in check. And if you believe in less government intervention, you might also believe that competition and antitrust enforcement are alternatives to regulation.Congress understood the value of competition and enshrined it in the Sherman and Clayton Acts. The Supreme Court, putting these concepts together, explained the necessity of free and unfettered competition.[3] “[T]he unrestrained interaction of competitive forces,” it said, “will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conductive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.”[4] “But even were that premise open to question,” the majority wrote, “the policy unequivocally laid down by the Act is competition.”[5]Maintaining competition is precisely the aim of the Clayton Act as well. Markets that are hobbled by anticompetitive restraints and concentrated by mergers cannot be expected to do what we want them to do. It is for that reason that Section 7 outlaws mergers that “may” operate “substantially to lessen competition” or “tend to create a monopoly.”[6] This is not a controversial mandate. For all the divisions that exist, the vast majority of people, of all stripes, seem to agree that markets should operate free of anticompetitive constraints and illegal market power.But for years enforcers and courts hesitated to fully realize this mandate. If you look around today, my guess is that you can identify plenty of markets that are not yielding the “best allocation of our economic resources” or characterized by the “lowest prices [and] the highest quality.” In my view, that is because we have often enough perceived the possibility that mergers may be illegal, but we have declined to wield the power Congress gave us. In the worst cases, we have usurped the will of Congress, intentionally underenforcing the antitrust laws by administrative fiat. In other cases, we have tried to make predictive judgments about the likelihood of harm—more specifically when anticompetitive effects might not come to pass. In such cases, increasingly we raised the standard that Congress explicitly set forth, requiring something near certainty about the effects of a merger to block it.Today, I’d like to talk through some examples of times when our reliance on predictions have failed us. I’ll then offer some suggestions for how we might think about an antitrust framework that is fit for purpose.I won’t hide my thesis. I’ve been at the Antitrust Division for nearly eight years. I’ve seen different approaches to antitrust enforcement and competition policy. What I know is there’s no Delorean with a flux capacitor sitting in the Antitrust Division’s metaphorical driveway. We don’t have Bill and Ted’s phone booth. When we try to predict to near certainty the precise effects of a deal, we can get it wrong.The question, of course, is what lesson to take from it. Perhaps, you say, if we can’t be certain about the ultimate effects of a merger, we should hang back and let market forces play out.To that I say: it is easier to assess competition than to predict to a near certainty the competitive effects of a deal in a dynamic world. It is also more consistent with the framework that Congress set forth.Congress was wise to this quandary. It knew the future of a marketplace is hard to predict, and believed that waiting for conduct to actually ripen into harm was an inadequate way to realize its goals. So, in passing the Clayton Act, it wrote a probabilistic statute that expressly did not require certainty about what happened in the future. Congress prohibited any merger whose effect “may be”—and those words, “may be,” are critical—substantially to lessen competition. Does that mean we prohibit more mergers than we would need to if we had a crystal ball that perfectly predicted the future? Of course. There is nothing radical about that approach. That was Congress’s design. As the Supreme Court explained, the Clayton Act is concerned “with probabilities, not certainties.”[7] Congress’s judgment was that we, in the words of the Supreme Court, need “to brake th[e] force” of “concentration in American business … at its outset and before it gathered momentum.”[8]I think we have often failed to take this standard at its word. And all too often, the exact harm we were concerned about, but predicted might not materialize, did. That is radical. I can think of no other substantive area of law so central to our economy and society that was nonetheless intentionally underenforced.We must take Congress’s will seriously. Here’s what that means in practice. When we look out and see various reasonably probable outcomes from a transaction, if one of them is a substantial lessening of competition, we should have a bias towards action. Section 7 doesn’t require certainty. It very well may be the case that no change in competition is also a possible outcome. Even that is not a bar to enforcement. We don’t need to ask what is the most likely outcome. We should not let a temptation to be crystal ball seers cloud our Congressionally-directed mission.II. Lessons from the pastTo illustrate this problem, I’d like to offer three examples.1. Digital Advertising: Google/DoubleClick and Google/AdMeldEarlier this week, we filed a landmark monopolization lawsuit against Google. Our complaint alleges in rich detail that, over the last 15 years, Google has unlawfully acquired and maintained monopoly power in digital advertising technologies.So, what happened 15 years ago? Google acquired DoubleClick, which was then the “leading firm in the third party ad serving markets.”[9] This acquisition was a turning point. As we alleged in our complaint, it “vaulted Google into a commanding position over the tools [website] publishers use to sell advertising” and “set the stage for Google’s later exclusionary conduct across the ad tech industry.”[10]Our investigation, of course, is not the first time an antitrust enforcer considered whether the DoubleClick acquisition would lead to anticompetitive ends. The FTC investigated the deal in 2007. As the Commission’s statements from the time make clear, they understood the possibility of harm even then. In fact, Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbour dissented from the Commission’s decision to close the investigation because “the combination of Google and DoubleClick has the potential to profoundly alter the 21st century Internet-based economy.”[11] Her clairvoyance was striking.Nevertheless, a majority of Commissioners predicted that these harms were unlikely. We know differently today.For example, the majority identified the risk that Google would “bundle or tie DoubleClick’s ad serving technology” to enhance its own position, or “leverage DoubleClick’s leading position in third party ad serving to its advantage in the ad intermediation market.”[12] But despite acknowledging this risk, the Commission did not take action because it was not certain this harm would come about. Now compare that prediction with what actually happened, as alleged in our complaint. After acquiring DoubleClick, “Google forged an exclusive link between Google Ads”—its homegrown, market-leading product—“and DFP through the AdX ad exchange”—the two products it acquired from DoubleClick.[13] As alleged in our complaint, and as Commissioner Harbour predicted, this move had “a profound effect on the evolution of digital advertising.”[14] It “tilted the industry in Google’s favor, driving publishers to adopt and stay on Google’s DFP publisher ad server in order to have access to Google Ads’ advertiser demand.”[15] And it “cut off the possibility that Google Ads’ advertising spending could sustain, or encourage the entry of, a rival ad exchange or publisher ad server.”[16]The FTC explained its reticence to take action. It predicted that the ad intermediation market was “unlikely to ‘tip’”[17] and that the third party ad serving markets were “competitive and … likely to become even more so in the future.”[18] Not so. Again, compare these statements with what actually happened, as alleged in our complaint. Because of Google’s conduct, DFP became the “only realistic publisher ad server option.”[19] Its share, according to Google’s own documents, grew to “a remarkable 90%,” which gave Google a “durable monopoly over the publisher ad server market.”[20]I could go on. The majority’s statement and the dissent read as a roadmap of the conduct Google actually undertook. Remarkably, it was clear to everyone what Google might do but, still, a majority of Commissioners wanted more certainty.I do not mean to call out the FTC. As citizens, we owe the FTC a huge debt of gratitude for its work to protect consumers. It is a tremendous agency whose staff and leadership over the years have engaged thoughtfully and deliberatively about the challenges of the moment. Its challenges are hardly exclusive.We at the Antitrust Division have fallen prey to the same thinking—with the exact same company. Just a few years after the DoubleClick acquisition, Google announced another step in its path toward dominance: the acquisition of AdMeld. AdMeld competed with Google to provide services to web publishers that facilitated the sale of display advertising space. We at the Division, like the FTC, identified a reasonable possibility of antitrust harm. But we thought this risk would not turn into reality. We predicted that “multi-homing,” a practice in which publishers would rely on multiple display advertising platforms, would “lessen[] the risk that the market will tip to a single dominant platform.”[21] We were wrong. “Google’s increasing scale and dominance across the ad tech stack, coupled with its subsequent exclusionary conduct, destroyed the ability of advertisers and publishers to effectively multi-home among alternative ad exchanges.”[22] As alleged in this week’s complaint, Google “folded [AdMeld’s] functionality into Google’s existing products, and then shut down its operations with non-Google ad exchanges and advertiser tools.”[23] And what happened? “As a result, the market tipped and AdX became the dominant ad exchange.”[24] As we allege in the complaint, “Google’s AdX is the largest ad exchange in the market; it is approximately four times larger than the next largest ad exchange . . . and has been for at least several years.”[25]2. Entertainment: AT&amp;T/Time-WarnerEven in full-blown trials, we see courts encounter the same challenges.In 2017, the Division sued to block the merger of AT&amp;T and Time Warner. At the time, the case was the first litigated vertical merger challenge in more than 40 years. Our theory of harm focused on the value of Time Warner’s entertainment content. We alleged that if AT&amp;T were able to pull Time Warner content from AT&amp;T’s content distribution rivals—called a “blackout”—it would drive those rivals’ customers to AT&amp;T. We alleged that this was an incentive built into the structure of the market.The Court did not challenge the legal viability of this theory. Nor did it dispute that there was some risk of this anticompetitive harm occurring. But, instead of blocking the merger, it relied on testimony from the companies’ executives to make a prediction: There “is likely never going to be[] an actual long-term blackout of Turner content,” it said, referring to a division of Time Warner.[26]A blackout of Time Warner content is exactly what happened. Less than six months after AT&amp;T consummated the transaction, it pulled HBO from all Dish networks, starting a multi-year blackout of Time Warner content.[27] This was the first blackout in HBO’s 43-year history. And it was decidedly “long-term.” Lasting nearly three years, it became “one of the longest-running carriage disputes in TV history.”[28]This should have come as no surprise. AT&amp;T owned DirecTV, Dish’s primary rival for satellite TV. And the blackout, in the words of the Wall Street Journal, created an incentive for Dish “viewers … to drift to rivals like AT&amp;T’s DirecTV.”[29] Dish itself blamed the power created by the merger for AT&amp;T’s conduct: “Plain and simple, the merger created for AT&amp;T immense power,” it claimed, and “AT&amp;T is implementing a new strategy to shut off its recently acquired content from other distributors.”[30]One other aspect of this case is worth mentioning: the predictions of efficiencies advanced by the parties and entertained by the court. After rejecting the Division’s theory of harm, the court predicted that the merger would yield “most, if not all” of the $1.5 billion in cost-savings suggested by the parties.[31] The merger, the companies and court seemed to say, would create a hyper-efficient body capable of delivering superior product to consumers.Of course, we know how the story ended. Just three years after the merger was consummated, the companies reversed course. AT&amp;T sold Time Warner, leading at least one national newspaper to wonder whether “this $100 billion deal [was] the worst merger ever.”[32]I would be remiss if I did not pause to reflect on the sentiment at the time this lawsuit was filed. The wisdom of the merger challenge was the subject of significant speculation and writing. Suffice it to say, I hope and believe history will vindicate the Antitrust Division, its tremendous staff, and my former boss Assistant Attorney General Delrahim who had the courage to bring the challenge.3. Beer: Miller/CoorsThe limits of our predictive power surface in other industries too. Consider beer.In 2008, the Division investigated a joint venture between Miller and Coors. We found that the two companies were close competitors—competition that would be lost after the transaction. We nonetheless allowed the deal to go forward on the theory that “the joint venture is likely to produce substantial and credible savings that will significantly reduce the companies’ costs of producing and distributing beer,” which would, in turn, “have a beneficial effect on prices.”[33]Did this “beneficial effect on prices” materialize? Not according to a 2017 merger retrospective by economists Nathan Miller and Matthew Weinberg. The authors found precisely the opposite. They document an “abrupt[]” increase in prices right after the deal was consummated.[34]  Importantly, these price increases were not only the result of unilateral effects—they also were evident in MillerCoors’ major competitor, Anheuser-Busch, suggesting coordinated effects.[35]III. The Path ForwardSo where does all of this leave us? I believe there are five lessons we can draw. 1. Congress says what it means and means what it says. We need to enforce the statute as Congress wrote it. Decades of Supreme Court precedent speak to the need to arrest concentration and trends towards concentration in their incipiency. In many cases, including those I’ve described today, agencies and courts accurately identified a risk to competition, but did not act because they weren’t sufficiently certain the harm would come to pass.But that is not the standard. Congress wrote a statute that applies whenever a merger “may” substantially lessen competition. It’s an incipiency statute. Congress was concerned that, if we wait until the harm has actually come about, it would be too late.We cannot wait for evidence that harm is sure to exist. It’s the rare case that we will see documentary evidence laying out a post-merger price hike or a plan to shutter innovation or diminish quality. That puts a premium on the value of structural evidence. When a change in market structure suggests that a firm will have an incentive to reduce competition, that should be enough. Congress did not write a statute asking whether a substantial lessening of competition was “certain” or the “most likely” outcome. As long as that harm “may” occur, the merger violates the law and should be enjoined.2. Accept that firms will exercise their market power.In every merger review, our core inquiry is: how does competition present itself in this industry? Once we see that a merger may lead to, or increase, a firm’s market power, only in very rare circumstances should we think that a firm will not exercise that power. Too often, judgments that a firm will obtain market power, but somehow not exercise it, have turned out to be wrong.Here’s what that means in more concrete terms. In the vast majority of circumstances, promises that companies will not exercise their market power, including for reasons of professed reputational concerns, should not be a viable defense to an otherwise anticompetitive merger. Reputation evidence, such as it is, is often too fleeting, too fickle, and too malleable to protect the public from illegal mergers and abuses of market power.The same is true of executive testimony and corporate promises to continue competing or freeze prices. Like reputation evidence, it puts the public at the mercy of the merged firm. Simply put, there is no guarantee that an executive’s view today will remain the company’s plan tomorrow.3. The structural presumption is an important proxy for market power.While competition analysis is more dynamic than static, information about market structure can help screen off the risks of unilateral effects and the likelihood of future oligopolistic behavior. The structural presumption, like other bright lines and rules, also helps businesses conform their conduct to the law with more confidence about how the agencies will view a proposed merger or conduct. Again, I come back to my thesis. It is easier to measure competition than to predict competitive effects in a dynamic world, and that is more consistent with the framework that Congress set forth.4. Be skeptical of efficiencies.When we think a merger may substantially lessen competition, the optimal remedy is to block it. Sometimes, I’ve heard a suggestion that a merger should be permitted, even though it decreases competition, because it creates efficiencies for the merged firm. This is not, however, the scheme Congress envisioned. It is competition that Congress wanted to preserve. Not efficiency. The Clayton Act does not ask whether a merger creates a more or less efficient firm—it asks about the effect of the merger on competition. The Supreme Court has never recognized efficiencies as a defense to an otherwise illegal merger. And in the exceedingly rare instances when low courts have considered them, they have explained that there is a high burden for demonstrating that efficiencies increase competition. ​​​​​​​5. We must be willing to litigate.Too often, instead of litigating to stop an anticompetitive merger, we have relied on consent decrees to try to fix the problem. We have relied on a prediction about what schemes would address, in the future, the structural issues created by a merger. Again, we have too often been wrong. The FTC’s own study on remedies, released in 2017, found that when the Commission relied on divestitures of limited packages of assets in horizontal, non-consummated mergers, the scheme failed to restore competition almost one third of the time.[36] Other studies released at the time suggested an even greater failure rate.Litigation is intrinsically risky. Enforcing a probabilistic statue comes with an inherent risk that a court will see probabilities differently. Perhaps our desire for certainty in merger enforcement was born out of this fear. But if we only challenge the cases in which we’re nearly positive that anticompetitive harm will come to pass, we’re not enforcing the law as Congress wrote it.If we take our mandate seriously, we need to acknowledge the possibility that sometimes a court might not agree with us—and yet go to court anyway.*          *          *At the Division, we are putting these principles to work. We are taking action when we think mergers imperil competition. We are not relying on untested efficiencies to approve mergers, nor are we coming up with predictions for why firms might not exercise the market power a merger gives them. When we see a reasonable probability that a merger may harm competition, our bias is to protect competition.And we are having success. In the recent Penguin Random House/Simon &amp; Schuster merger, our investigation showed that the acquisition would have enabled Penguin, which was already the largest book publisher in the world, to exert outsized influence over which books are published in the United States and how much authors are paid for their work.[37] So we took the parties to court. And we won. This victory was important because it was principally a merger challenge about monopsony power.In other matters, parties have abandoned mergers after we expressed competition concerns. Cargotec and Konecranes proposed a merger that we believed threatened to harm competition in the sale of shipping container handling equipment, which is critical to the global supply chain. The parties ultimately abandoned the deal.[38] When Verzatec, a producer and seller of pebbled fiberglass reinforced plastic wall panels sought to acquire its biggest competitor, Crane, we filed suit under both Section 7 and Section 2.[39] There, too, the parties walked away. And, similarly, when two of the world’s four suppliers of insulated container boxes and refrigerated shipping containers sought to merge, the Division conducted a thorough investigation, prompting the parties to abandon.[40] In all of these cases, we observed the risk of harm to competition and focused on taking action.Of course, not all cases will turn out in our favor. The fact that we have not won every case we have brought is, to me, a feature, and not a bug, of our approach to enforcing the law Congress wrote. The desire for certainty is at least one root cause of our underenforcement in recent years.Here’s what I’d like to leave with you today. We share a common goal in protecting competitive markets. We share a belief that companies should be able to compete on the merits and the best ones should win. And I suspect we also agree that the world, and our economy, are complex, and we are enforcement cannot be conditioned on reliably predicting the effects of deals with certainty.If we do indeed share these premises, I’d like you to consider the prescription I’ve given about the way forward: it is easier to measure competition than to predict competitive effects in a dynamic world, and that is more consistent with the framework that Congress set forth.From my experience, when we demand certainty, we raise the standards for enforcement well beyond what the statute contemplates and we underenforce the law. Congress wrote a statute concerned with probabilities and focused on stopping incipient threats.      As the saying goes, the time is late and I must be going now.Let me close by saying what an honor it is to be with you. I congratulate you again, Alden, on today’s event.Thank you.  [1] https://www.mercatus.org/about-mercatus[2] See, e.g., Milton Friedman, A Friedman doctrine – The Social Responsibility Of Business Is to Increase Its Profits, N.Y.

                                                                                                                                                                                                          Good morning! I am delighted to be with you all in New Orleans, the traditional and sacred homeland of the Chitimacha, Choctaw, Houma, and Biloxi peoples.I believe it is crucial that we acknowledge the original, rightful and continuing stewards of this land. However, that acknowledgment means little if not accompanied by action following the leadership of Tribal advocates and survivors.That is why it is so important for OVW to be here: to be guided by the voices of all who are here in this room today.Our work is driven by the principle that we cannot end violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women without centering Tribal sovereignty. And all OVW’s work – not just our Tribal Affairs Division but all our grants and policies – are only effective when they are informed by Tribal leaders and designees.In that vein, under the Violence Against Women Act – or VAWA – the Department of Justice, in coordination with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services, holds an annual government-to-government consultation with Tribal leaders on responding to violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women. OVW is honored to plan and host the consultation, which we held in Alaska for the first time ever last year.Every year at consultation, we hear powerful and sometimes heartbreaking testimony from Tribal leaders and designees who are living through the unbearable devastation of losing a loved one – of not knowing if someone missing will ever return.We cannot underestimate the role that sex trafficking has in these cases. Years ago, the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition (MIWSAC) was the first to tell me about the shocking rates of sex trafficking in Indian Country: MIWSAC told me that girls were being recruited or even abducted while waiting for the bus. MIWSAC is still leading the way in documenting the problem and identifying strategies to stop it.This year, we conducted site visits in Alaska, and we heard that Alaska Native youth who leave home for Anchorage are approached by traffickers within days of arriving. We heard about Alaska Native youth in foster care in Ketchikan who had been trafficked, though they wouldn’t have defined themselves as victims and needed culturally specific responses that met them where they were. And we heard about the role of fishing fleets and extractive industries in exacerbating sex trafficking.Tribes need tools to address this.Last year, VAWA was reauthorized and restored Tribes’ inherent sovereign jurisdiction to Tribes to prosecute non-Indian perpetrators of sex trafficking, among other offenses – including sexual violence and child abuse in the context of domestic violence – committed on Tribal lands.The law also expands this jurisdiction to Alaska Native villages, who were left out of the previous legal framework. These victories for Tribal sovereignty are thanks to the determined advocacy of so many represented at this conference.If you have ever doubted that your voice counts in Washington, just look at VAWA. People said it couldn’t be done but you made it happen.And you worked for these historic wins because you are in community with those who are directly impacted. You yourselves are impacted. You are supporting survivors every day, and COVID-19 introduced an entirely new set of shifting circumstances for you to overcome.So, I want to thank you not only for your work on VAWA 2022, but for being here today, and my special thanks to Nicole Matthews and everyone at MIWSAC, Men as Peacemakers, the Tribal Law and Policy Institute and Mending the Sacred Hoop for bringing us together for this incredibly important conference.Addressing the disproportionately high rates of violence experienced by Indigenous people, including sexual violence and sex trafficking and relatedly, the high rates of Indigenous people who are missing, is a priority not just for OVW but for the entire Department of Justice.The missing and murdered Indigenous persons – or MMIP – crisis requires trauma-informed, victim-centered responses from across the Department of Justice.Last year, the Department launched an MMIP page with helpful resources for survivors and their loved ones, Tribal communities, law enforcement agencies and officers, and service providers. That can be found at justice.gov/Tribal/mmip.But we know we have much more to do, and we are guided in that work by the words of Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, in her directive creating a Justice Department Steering Committee to address the MMIP crisis, “The Department recognizes that challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions, and the Steering Committee should therefore make Tribal engagement the cornerstone of its work.” I want to reiterate, “the challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions.”I serve on the Not Invisible Act Commission, and I am proud to see those Tribal solutions at the heart of the commission’s work.But of course, those Tribal solutions need funding to succeed, and we want to support you. We want to invest in you and help you succeed once you get those federal funds. We are posting new grant solicitations – some are already online now – and I must encourage you to apply. Most of our grants prioritize Tribal organizations or Tribal governments in some way, so please look at all our available solicitations and not just the ones specific to Tribes. Information on our grants, purpose areas, and how to apply can all be found on our website, and we’ve brought informational material for you to take.I’ve been an applicant and a grantee myself, so I know it’s not as easy as just saying “apply!” We are working hard to make applications simpler, and our Tribal Affairs Division has done great work to revise and streamline applications – particularly for our grants to support Tribes in implementing that newly broadened special Tribal criminal jurisdiction.Another opportunity to build your own capacity and help OVW fund more Tribal organizations is to be a peer reviewer of grant applications. The peer review process involves active professionals from the field assessing applications against the criteria in the solicitation and selecting the best in the pool. When you serve as a peer reviewer, you get a behind-the-scenes look at how to be a successful applicant.You also bring your unique expertise. You help ensure that applications from Tribes and Tribal organizations are being reviewed by people who understand those communities, by people from those very communities, by people who know what culturally specific services look like. You can visit OVW’s website for more information and fill out the recruitment form to submit via email.I want to close by thanking the survivors in the audience. To everyone who has struggled and is here today to turn that pain into action: we see you. We stand with you. We will fight side by side with you. We are going to change the world together.Thank you. #> 6

                                                                         Good afternoon.Unfortunately, I am going to begin my remarks today just as I did yesterday: offering my condolences to the families of the victims of yet another mass shooting in our country.All of us at the Justice Department, including the FBI and ATF, will continue to support the Half Moon Bay community in the difficult days ahead. And as I said yesterday, the Justice Department is committed to doing everything in our power to protect our communities from the gun violence that is leaving no community in this country untouched.Today, the Department of Justice, joined by eight states, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Google.We allege that Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful conduct to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies.These technologies, which are known as “ad tech,” automate advertising sales by website publishers to online advertisers.When an internet user opens a webpage that has ad space to sell, ad tech tools almost instantly match the website publisher with an advertiser looking to promote its products or services to the website's user.  This product and process typically involves the use of an automated advertising exchange. This exchange runs a high-speed auction designed to identify the best match between a publisher selling internet ad space and advertisers looking to buy it.As alleged in our complaint, for 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anticompetitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition, and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools.In so doing, Google has engaged in exclusionary conduct to severely weaken, if not destroy, competition in the ad tech industry.As detailed in our complaint, we allege that Google's anticompetitive conduct extends to three significant elements of the digital ad buying process.First, Google controls the technology used by nearly every major website publisher to offer advertising space for sale.Second, Google controls the leading tool used by advertisers to buy that advertising space.And, third, Google controls the largest ad exchange that matches publishers and advertisers together each time that ad space is sold.As a result of this scheme, website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more. That means fewer publishers are able to offer internet users content without subscriptions, paywalls, or other forms of monetization.Our complaint alleges that Google has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by:Monopolizing the market for the technology used by publishers to offer ads on their websites;Monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the ad exchange market; andMonopolizing the market for the ad network technology advertisers use to buy digital advertising space.  Our complaint also alleges that Google has unlawfully tied its ad exchange and its publisher ad server, in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. And finally, we allege that the United States, as an advertiser, has incurred damages by reason of Google's violations of the antitrust laws. In addition to declaratory relief, our complaint seeks damages and the divestiture of certain Google ad tech products. It also seeks an injunction preventing Google from continuing to engage in the anticompetitive practices described in the complaint, and any other practices with the same purpose and effect as the challenged practices.I am grateful to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki, and the attorneys and staff of the Antitrust Division for their tireless work on this case.Monopolies threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation, they hurt producers and workers, and they increase costs for consumers.Today's complaint is only the latest example of the Department's work to challenge antitrust violations that undermine competition and harm the American people.No matter the industry and no matter the company, the Justice Department will vigorously enforce our antitrust laws. We will aggressively protect consumers, safeguard competition, and work to ensure economic fairness and opportunity for all.I will now turn the podium over to Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta. #>      changed    created       date #> 1 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 2 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 3 2023-01-27 2023-01-26 2023-01-26 #> 4 2023-01-27 2023-01-27 2023-01-26 #> 5 2023-01-25 2023-01-25 2023-01-25 #> 6 2023-01-24 2023-01-24 2023-01-24 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     teaser #> 1                              Thank you, Kris, for that introduction and for your leadership, which is so powerful, always.
