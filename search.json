            From October 27 to November 7, ICITAP’s Engaging Multinational Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) program conducted a surveillance and counter surveillance training for 15 female officers in Jordan’s Public Security Directorate's (PSD) Special Branch (SB). The officers participating in the training are assigned to the SB’s Special Surveillance Unit and/or the newly established All-Female Counterterrorism Team. The training lasted three weeks in total and covered elements critical to physical surveillance operations, such as mission planning, foot and vehicle surveillance, threat recognition, among other topics. This training is the first of two iterations planned for SB in closing of 2024 activities. Via participation in this course, EMPoWER is seeking to strengthen SB’s female officer’s capacity to engage in operational assignments. EMPoWER continues to work with SB to increase the meaningful participation of women in counterterrorism law enforcement. In Jordan, ICITAP-EMPoWER is managed with the support of and in coordination with the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism. #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      From October 28, 2024, to November 1, ICITAP, with support and funding from the U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), trained 19 officials from the Colombian National Police (CNP) and the Attorney General’s Office (AGO) Technical Investigations Corps (CTI) in the planning to solve criminal cases course.

Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the \"Wordly\" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section. The IACP and IMPACT Section annual memberships allow members access to IACP policies, to network, and to gain from emailed policing information including webinars, good practices, and Quarterly IACP IMPACT Section international police Zoom meetings and presentations. Several ICITAP employees and contractors hold key positions in the leadership of the IACP and IACP IMPACT Section, which greatly enhances international police opportunities for all attendees hosted through ICITAP. #> 6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The Office of Information Policy (OIP) is pleased to announce that the Chief FOIA Officers (CFO) Council will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday, November 7th 2024 from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM ET.&nbsp;

of finalizing their Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&nbsp; Those two reports, which are submitted to the Department of Justice each year and are made public, serve as a key means by which each agency is held accountable for its compliance with the FOIA, as well as with the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp;Completion of these reports serves another valuable function as well.&nbsp; They are valuable tools for agencies to use in assessing the strengths and weaknesses of their own FOIA compliance and operations so that improvements can be made in the months and years ahead.&nbsp;Both reports provide agencies with a wealth of information.&nbsp; Annual FOIA Reports contain details regarding the numbers of requests received and processed, as well as the disposition of those requests and the time taken to respond to them.&nbsp; Chief FOIA Officer Reports describe the steps agencies have taken to improve transparency in accordance with the President's and Attorney General's directives, including descriptions of efforts to increase efficiency, expand proactive disclosures, maximize use of technology, and reduce backlogs.Together, these reports provide a valuable foundation for each agency to use in reviewing and assessing its own efforts to improve how they implement the FOIA.&nbsp; March is also the mid-point in the current fiscal year.&nbsp; So, this month is a particularly good time for all agencies to review how they are doing to date in Fiscal Year 2011, to make any necessary adjustments to their operations, to assess and prioritize their goals for the remainder of this year, and ensure that they are on track for closing out their ten oldest pending requests.&nbsp;An agency FOIA conference is an ideal way in which to do all these things.&nbsp; At the Department of Justice, OIP is holding a DOJ FOIA Conference for all DOJ's FOIA professionals on March 24.&nbsp; OIP will include specialized training at the conference to address commonly occurring issues.&nbsp; OIP will also have break-out sessions for each component so that individualized discussions can occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many agencies already have FOIA conferences scheduled for the next few weeks. These conferences can be informal discussion sessions or more formal events with training included.&nbsp; OIP is available to assist agencies with their conferences and can provide training on any aspect of the FOIA as well as on the new FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; Whatever the format of the conference, OIP encourages all agencies to consider hosting FOIA conferences with their own FOIA professionals in the upcoming weeks.&nbsp; Such conferences can provide a helpful, meaningful way for agencies to work internally to improve their compliance with the FOIA and to increase transparency overall.&nbsp; This, in turn, will be the foundation of what is reported next year in each agency's Annual FOIA Report and Chief FOIA Officer Report. #> 2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Guidelines for 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports President Obama’s FOIA MemorandumOn his first full day in office, President Obama demonstrated his commitment to the ideals of transparency and openness by issuing a Memorandum to the heads of all Executive Branch Departments and agencies calling on them to “renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA.” The President directed all agencies to administer the FOIA with a clear presumption in favor of disclosure, to ensure that requests are responded to in “a spirit of cooperation,” that disclosures are made timely, and that modern technology is used to make information available to the public even before a request is made.Attorney General Holder’s FOIA GuidelinesIn accordance with the President’s directive, on March 19, 2009, Attorney General Holder issued new FOIA guidelines which called on all agencies to reaffirm the government’s “commitment to accountability and transparency.” The Attorney General strongly encouraged agencies to make discretionary disclosures of information and to consider making partial disclosures when full disclosures are not possible.In his FOIA Guidelines, the Attorney General also comprehensively addressed the need for each agency to ensure that it has in place an effective system for responding to requests. The Attorney General stressed the importance of proactive disclosures of information and use of technology, as well as the need to respond to requests promptly. Significantly, in his FOIA Guidelines the Attorney General emphasized that \"[e]ach agency must be fully accountable for its administration of the FOIA.\"Agency AccountabilityThe Attorney General has highlighted the key role played by each agency’s Chief FOIA Officer and emphasized that “[i]mproving FOIA performance requires the[ir] active participation.” Accordingly, the Attorney General directed agency Chief FOIA Officers to review \"all aspects of their agencies' FOIA administration\" and to report each year to the Department of Justice on the steps taken \"to improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure.\"Agencies submitted their first Chief FOIA Officer Reports in March 2010 and reported on a wide variety of initiatives, big and small, that had been undertaken across the government to improve transparency in keeping with the Attorney General’s FOIA Guidelines. OIP prepared an extensive summary of the information contained in those reports, and issued guidance to agencies on steps they could take to achieve even greater transparency in the years ahead.In March 2011, agencies submitted their second Chief FOIA Officer Reports. Building on the initiatives from the preceding years, agencies across the government once again reported that they had taken numerous concrete steps to achieve greater transparency. In 2011, agencies were asked for the first time to highlight particular initiatives that were emblematic of their efforts. OIP compiled and posted a summary of those success stories. In July 2011, OIP prepared an assessment of the fifteen key agencies' compliance with the Attorney General’s FOIA Guidelines, combining pertinent details described in their Chief FOIA Officer Reports with data from their agency Annual FOIA Reports. The assessment was designed to provide an overall picture of the progress made by the key agencies under the FOIA Guidelines.In March 2012 and 2013, agencies submitted their third and fourth Chief FOIA Officer Reports, which continued to provide a wealth of detail about initiatives undertaken by agencies to improve their administration of the FOIA. In each of those years, OIP prepared a comprehensive assessment expanded to include all ninety-nine agencies subject to the FOIA in Fiscal Years 2011 and 2012, coupled with a summary of all the agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports. In these summaries OIP highlighted examples of agency achievements and discussed the results of its review of agencies' Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&nbsp; Along with the summary and assessment issued in 2012 and 2013, OIP also provided guidance to agencies for further improvement. &nbsp;Specifically, in 2012 OIP's guidance advised agencies of the importance of utilizing advanced technology to process requests, the need to employ multiple processing tracks, and the significance of closing their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each year. &nbsp;In 2013, OIP's guidance advised agencies to focus on providing quality FOIA training to staff, improving processing times for simple track requests and once again addressed the need for agencies to continue to make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests, appeals and consultations every year.OIP intends to do an assessment yet again after submission of the 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports.Topics to Be Addressed in 2014 Chief FOIA Officer ReportsIn accordance with the Attorney General’s FOIA Guidelines, OIP is charged with the responsibility for providing guidance to agencies on the timing and content of agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports to the Attorney General. The guidelines for the 2014 Reports are set out below. As was done the last four years, agencies should address the five key areas discussed below in their 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports, specifically: 1) the steps taken to apply the presumption of openness; 2) the steps taken to ensure that the agency has an efficient and effective system in place for responding to requests; 3) the steps taken to increase proactive disclosures; 4) the steps taken to improve use of technology; and 5) the steps taken to reduce any backlogs of pending FOIA requests and to improve timeliness in responding to requests.While the overall topics to be addressed in the reports remain the same, for 2014 OIP has once again modified and updated the questions that are asked.&nbsp; In the course of planning for these guidelines OIP met with representatives of civil society and has taken their input into account.&nbsp;As agencies continue to make improvements in their FOIA operations it is important that the Chief FOIA Officer Reports reflect the more advanced steps agencies are taking to apply the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; At the same time, it is also important that the Chief FOIA Officer Reports address those areas where agencies need to improve.&nbsp; As a result, the 2014 Guidelines for Chief FOIA Officer Reports include several new requirements that agencies provide plans for addressing certain goals, such as ensuring that training is provided to all FOIA professionals, that quarterly reporting is timely posted, that FOIA professionals are being converted to the new Government Information Specialist job series, that expedited processing requests are adjudicated within ten calendar days, that the “ten oldest” requests, appeals, and consultations are closed each fiscal year, and that significant request backlogs are reduced.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As is now customary, agencies are being asked to report whether they used any of the FOIA’s statutory exclusions, see 5 U.S.C. § 552(c) (2006 &amp; Supp. IV 2010), during Fiscal Year 2013. To provide greater transparency on the utilization of these special law enforcement provisions, the Department issued guidance in 2012 requiring all agencies to report each year in their Chief FOIA Officer Reports whether they used an exclusion and, if so, how many times, during the preceding fiscal year.&nbsp;Lastly, for the 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports each agency is asked to include at least one transparency success story from the past reporting period that they would like to highlight. These success stories are compiled by OIP and highlighted each year in connection with Sunshine Week.Format of 2014 Chief FOIA Officer ReportsAs has been done the last three years, the 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports should provide an overall picture of each agency’s activities undertaken pursuant to Attorney General Holder’s FOIA Guidelines. Thus, even for those agencies that process requests on a decentralized basis, by component, the Chief FOIA Officer Report should not be broken down by component. Instead, it should be organized by the five key topical areas. Then, within the discussion of each key area, data and examples from the agency’s various components can be provided. That approach makes it easier to get a picture of how the agency as a whole is addressing all the aspects of the Attorney General’s FOIA Guidelines.The Guidelines are set up so that they can serve as a template for agencies to follow in preparing their 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports. Agencies must answer all the questions and include any additional narrative information to explain the various steps they have taken to improve transparency. &nbsp;As mentioned above, for some areas, depending on the agency’s answer, there might be a need to provide a plan for future action to address an area in need of improvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;Assessing Agency Progress in 2014For the 2014 assessment of agency progress OIP intends to expand its scoring system from the three stoplight colors (green, yellow, and red) used in previous assessments to five scores.&nbsp; For each agency OIP will also assess a score for each topical area as well as an overall score for the agency.&nbsp; These changes will allow more differentiation to be made and should enhance the value of the assessment.&nbsp; Because the answers provided in the Chief FOIA Officer Reports form the basis for much of the assessment, agencies are encouraged to provide any additional information that explains the reason for a given answer, when appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deadlines for Submitting 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports The fifteen Federal Departments must submit their Chief FOIA Officer Reports to OIP for review no later than January 17, 2014.All other agencies must submit their Chief FOIA Officer Reports to OIP for review no later than February 3, 2014. The drafts should be submitted by email to DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov. Please use the following text for the subject line of the email: Draft [insert agency name] Chief FOIA Officer Report.After the reports are reviewed and cleared by OIP, they should be posted on each agency’s website. OIP, in turn, will make all the Chief FOIA Officer Reports available to the public on the Department of Justice’s website. For 2014, agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports should be posted in final form by no later than March 17, 2014.If you have any questions regarding your 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Report, you can contact Bobak Talebian, Jacob Bishop-Green, or Bertina Adams of OIP at 202-514-3642, or by using the e-mail noted above.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Time frame for ReportUnless otherwise noted, your 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Report should address agency activities that have occurred since the filing of last year’s Report, which was March 11, 2013, up until the filing of the 2014 Report, which will be March 10, 2014. Thus, the general reporting period for the Chief FOIA Officer Reports is March 2013 to March 2014.Content of 2014 Chief FOIA Officer ReportsName and Title of your Agency's Chief FOIA Officer:Section I: Steps Taken to Apply the Presumption of OpennessThe guiding principle underlying the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines is the presumption of openness.Describe the steps your agency has taken to ensure that the presumption of openness is being applied to all decisions involving the FOIA. To do so, you should answer the questions listed below and then include any additional information you would like to describe how your agency is working to apply the presumption of openness.FOIA Training:\\tDid your agency hold an agency FOIA conference, or otherwise conduct training during this reporting period?\\tIf so, please provide the number of conferences or trainings held, a brief description of the topics covered, and an estimate of the number of participants from your agency who were in attendance. &nbsp;&nbsp;\\tDid your FOIA professionals attend any FOIA training during the reporting period such as that provided by the Department of Justice?\\tProvide an estimate of the percentage of your FOIA professionals who attended substantive FOIA training during this reporting period.&nbsp;\\tOIP has issued guidance that every agency should make core, substantive FOIA training available to all their FOIA professionals at least once each year.&nbsp; Provide your agency’s plan for ensuring that such training is offered to all agency FOIA professionals by March 2015.&nbsp; Your plan should anticipate an upcoming reporting requirement for your 2015 Chief FOIA Officer Reports that will ask whether all agency FOIA professionals attended substantive FOIA training in the past year.&nbsp;Outreach: \\tDid your FOIA professionals engage in any outreach and dialogue with the requester community or open government groups regarding your administration of the FOIA?&nbsp; &nbsp;If so, please briefly discuss that engagement.Discretionary Disclosures:In his 2009 FOIA Guidelines, the Attorney General strongly encouraged agencies to make discretionary releases of information even when the information might be technically exempt from disclosure under the FOIA. OIP encourages agencies to make such discretionary releases whenever there is no foreseeable harm from release.\\tDoes your agency have a formal process in place to review records for discretionary release?&nbsp; If so, please briefly describe this process.&nbsp; If your agency is decentralized, please specify whether all components at your agency have a process in place for making discretionary releases.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\tDuring the reporting period did your agency make any discretionary releases of otherwise exempt information?\\tWhat exemptions would have covered the information that was released as a matter of discretion?\\tProvide a narrative description, or some examples of, the types of information that your agency released as a matter of discretion.\\tIf your agency was not able to make any discretionary releases of information, please explain why.Other Initiatives:\\tDid your agency post all of the required quarterly FOIA reports for Fiscal Year 2013?&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, please explain why not and what your plan is for ensuring that such reporting is successfully accomplished for Fiscal Year 2014.\\tDescribe any other initiatives undertaken by your agency to ensure that the presumption of openness is being applied. If any of these initiatives are online, please provide links in your description.Section II: Steps Taken to Ensure that Your AgencyHas an Effective System in Place for Responding to Requests As the Attorney General emphasized in his FOIA Guidelines, \"[a]pplication of the proper disclosure standard is only one part of ensuring transparency. Open government requires not just a presumption of disclosure, but also an effective system for responding to FOIA requests.\" &nbsp;It is essential that agencies effectively manage their FOIA program.Describe here the steps your agency has taken to ensure that your management of your FOIA program is effective and efficient. To do so, answer the questions below and then include any additional information that you would like to describe how your agency ensures that your FOIA system is efficient and effective.&nbsp;Personnel:During Sunshine Week 2012 OPM announced the creation of a new job series entitled the Government Information Series, to address the work performed by FOIA and Privacy Act professionals.&nbsp; Creation of this distinct job series was a key element in recognizing the professional nature of their work.\\tHas your agency converted all of its FOIA professionals to the new Government Information Specialist job series?&nbsp;\\tIf not, what proportion of personnel has been converted to the new job series?&nbsp;\\tIf not, what is your plan to ensure that all FOIA professionals’ position descriptions are converted?&nbsp;&nbsp;Processing Procedures:\\tFor Fiscal Year 2013 did your agency maintain an average of ten or less calendar days to adjudicate requests for expedited processing?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, describe the steps your agency will take to ensure that requests for expedited processing are adjudicated within ten calendar days or less.&nbsp;\\tHas your agency taken any steps to make the handling of consultations and referrals more efficient and effective, such as entering into agreements with other agencies or components on how to handle certain categories or types of records involving shared equities so as to avoid the need for a consultation or referral altogether, or otherwise implementing procedures that speed up or eliminate the need for consultations.&nbsp; If so, please describe those steps.&nbsp;Requester Services:\\tDo you use e-mail or other electronic means to communicate with requesters when feasible?\\tDoes your agency notify requesters of the mediation services offered by the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) at NARA?&nbsp;\\tDescribe any other steps your agency has undertaken to ensure that your FOIA system operates efficiently and effectively, such as conducting self-assessments to find greater efficiencies, improving search processes, eliminating redundancy, etc.Section III: Steps Taken to Increase Proactive DisclosuresBoth the President and Attorney General focused on the need for agencies to work proactively to post information online without waiting for individual requests to be received.Describe here the steps your agency has taken both to increase the amount of material that is available on your agency website, and the usability of such information, including providing examples of proactive disclosures that have been made during this past reporting period (i.e., from March 2013 to March 2014). In doing so, answer the questions listed below and describe any additional steps taken by your agency to make and improve proactive disclosures of information.Posting Material:\\tDo your FOIA professionals have a system in place to identify records for proactive disclosures?\\tIf so, describe the system that is in place.\\tProvide examples of material that your agency has posted this past reporting period, including links to where this material can be found online.Making Posted Material More Useful: \\tBeyond posting new material, is your agency taking steps to make the posted information more useful to the public, especially to the community of individuals who regularly access your agency’s website, such as soliciting feedback on the content and presentation of posted material, improving search capabilities on the site, posting material in open formats, making information available through mobile applications, providing explanatory material, etc.?\\tIf so, provide examples of such improvements.\\tDid your agency use any means to publicize or highlight important proactive disclosures for public awareness? If so, was social media utilized?&nbsp;\\tHas your agency encountered challenges that make it difficult to post records you otherwise would like to post?&nbsp; If so, please briefly explain what those challenges are.&nbsp;\\tDescribe any other steps taken to increase proactive disclosures at your agency.Section IV: Steps Taken to Greater Utilize Technology A key component of the President's FOIA Memorandum was the direction to \"use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government.\" In addition to using the internet to make proactive disclosures, agencies should also be exploring ways to utilize technology in responding to requests. Over the past several years agencies have reported widespread use of technology in receiving and tracking FOIA requests and preparing agency Annual FOIA Reports. For 2014, as we have done over the past years, the questions have been further refined and now also address different, more innovative aspects of technology use.Online tracking of FOIA requests:\\tCan a FOIA requester track the status of his/her request electronically?\\tIf yes, how is this tracking function provided to the public? For example, is it being done through regularly updated FOIA logs, online portals, or other mediums?\\tDescribe the information that is provided to the requester through the tracking system. For example, some tracking systems might tell the requester whether the request is \"open\" or \"closed,\" while others will provide further details to the requester throughout the course of the processing, such as \"search commenced\" or \"documents currently in review.” List the specific types of information that are available through your agency's tracking system.\\tIn particular, does your agency tracking system provide the requester with an estimated date of completion for his/her request?\\tIf your agency does not provide online tracking of requests, is your agency taking steps to establish this capability?&nbsp; If not, please explain why.Use of technology to facilitate processing of requests:\\tBeyond using technology to redact documents, is your agency taking steps to utilize more advanced technology to facilitate overall FOIA efficiency, such as improving record search capabilities, utilizing document sharing platforms for consultations and referrals, or employing software that can sort and de-duplicate documents?\\tIf so, describe the technological improvements being made.\\tAre there additional technological tools that would be helpful to achieving further efficiencies in your agency’s FOIA program?&nbsp;Section V: Steps Taken to Improve Timeliness in Responding to Requests and Reducing Backlogs The President and the Attorney General have emphasized the importance of improving timeliness in responding to requests. This section addresses both time limits and backlog reduction. Backlog reduction is measured both in terms of numbers of backlogged requests or appeals and by looking at whether agencies closed their ten oldest requests, appeals, and consultations. For the figures required in this Section, please use those contained in the specified sections of your agency’s 2013 Annual FOIA Report and, when applicable, your agency’s 2012 Annual FOIA Report.Simple Track Requests:\\tSection VII.A of your agency’s Annual FOIA Report, entitled “FOIA Requests – Response Time for All Processed Requests,” includes figures that show your agency's average response times for processed requests. For agencies utilizing a multi-track system to process requests, there is a category for “simple” requests, which are those requests that are placed in the agency’s fastest (non-expedited) track, based on the low volume and/or simplicity of the records requested.\\tDoes your agency utilize a separate track for simple requests?\\tIf so, for your agency overall, for Fiscal Year 2013, was the average number of days to process simple requests twenty working days or fewer?\\tIf your agency does not track simple requests separately, was the average number of days to process non-expedited requests twenty working days or fewer?Backlogs and “Ten Oldest” Requests, Appeals and Consultations:\\tSection XII.A of your agency’s Annual FOIA Report, entitled “Backlogs of FOIA Requests and Administrative Appeals” shows the numbers of any backlogged requests or appeals from the fiscal year. &nbsp;Section VII.E, entitled “Pending Requests – Ten Oldest Pending Requests,” Section VI.C.(5), entitled “Ten Oldest Pending Administrative Appeals,” and Section XII.C., entitled \"Consultations on FOIA Requests – Ten Oldest Consultations Received from Other Agencies and Pending at Your Agency,\" show the ten oldest pending requests, appeals, and consultations.&nbsp; You should refer to these numbers from your Annual FOIA Reports for both Fiscal Year 2012 and Fiscal Year 2013 when completing this section of your Chief FOIA Officer Report.Backlogs \\tIf your agency had a backlog of requests at the close of Fiscal Year 2013, did that backlog decrease as compared with Fiscal Year 2012?\\tIf your agency had a backlog of administrative appeals in Fiscal Year 2013, did that backlog decrease as compared to Fiscal Year 2012?Ten Oldest Requests\\tIn Fiscal Year 2013, did your agency close the ten oldest requests that were pending as of the end of Fiscal Year 2012?\\tIf no, please provide the number of these requests your agency was able to close by the end of the fiscal year, as listed in Section VII.E of your Fiscal Year 2012 Annual FOIA Report.&nbsp; If you had less than ten total oldest requests to close, please indicate that.&nbsp; For example, if you only had seven requests listed as part of your \"ten oldest\" in Section VII.E. and you closed two of them, you should note that you closed two out of seven “oldest” requests.&nbsp;Ten Oldest Appeals\\tIn Fiscal Year 2013, did your agency close the ten oldest administrative appeals that were pending as of the end of Fiscal Year 2012?\\tIf no, please provide the number of these appeals your agency was able to close, as well as the number of appeals your agency had in Section VI.C.(5) of your Fiscal Year 2012 Annual FOIA Report.Ten Oldest Consultations\\tIn Fiscal Year 2013, did your agency close the ten oldest consultations received by your agency and pending as of the end of Fiscal Year 2012?\\tIf no, please provide the number of these consultations your agency did close, as well as the number of pending consultations your agency listed in Section XII.C. of your Fiscal Year 2012 Annual FOIA Report.&nbsp;Reasons for Any Backlogs:\\tIf you answered “no” to any of the questions in item 2 above, describe why your agency was not able to reduce backlogs and/or close the ten oldest pending requests, appeals, and consultations.&nbsp; In doing so, answer the following questions then include any additional explanation:\\t\\tRequest and/or Appeal Backlog\\tWas the lack of a reduction in the request and/or appeal backlog a result of an increase in the number of incoming requests or appeals?\\tWas the lack of a reduction in the request and/or appeal backlog caused by a loss of staff?\\tWas the lack of a reduction in the request and/or appeal backlog caused by an increase in the complexity of the requests received?\\tWhat other causes, if any, contributed to the lack of a decrease in the request and/or appeal backlog?“Ten oldest” Not Closed\\tBriefly explain the obstacles your agency faced in closing its ten oldest requests, appeals, and consultations from Fiscal Year 2012.&nbsp;\\tIf your agency was unable to close any of its ten oldest requests or appeals because you were waiting to hear back from other agencies on consultations you sent, please provide the date the request was initially received by your agency, the date when your agency sent the consultation, and the date when you last contacted the agency where the consultation was pending.&nbsp;Plans for Closing of Ten Oldest Pending Requests, Appeals, and Consultations and Reducing Backlogs:Given the importance of these milestones, it is critical that Chief FOIA Officers assess the causes for not achieving success and create plans to address them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\\tIf your agency did not close its ten oldest pending requests, appeals, and consultations, please provide a plan describing how your agency intends to close those “ten oldest” requests, appeals, and consultations during Fiscal Year 2014.\\tIf your agency had a backlog of more than 1000 pending requests and did not reduce that backlog in Fiscal Year 2013, provide your agency’s plan for achieving backlog reduction in the year ahead.&nbsp;Interim Responses:OIP has issued guidance encouraging agencies to make interim releases whenever they are working on requests that involve a voluminous amount of material or require searches in multiple locations. By providing rolling releases to requesters agencies facilitate access to the requested information.\\tDoes your agency have a system in place to provide interim responses to requesters when appropriate?&nbsp;\\tIf your agency had a backlog in Fiscal Year 2013, please provide an estimate of the number or percentage of cases in the backlog where a substantive, interim response was provided during the fiscal year, even though the request was not finally closed.Use of FOIA’s Law Enforcement “Exclusions”In order to increase transparency regarding the use of the FOIA’s statutory law enforcement exclusions, which authorize agencies under certain exceptional circumstances to “treat the records as not subject to the requirements of [the FOIA],” 5 U.S.C. § 552(c)(1), (2), (3), please answer the following questions:\\tDid your agency invoke a statutory exclusion during Fiscal Year 2013?\\tIf so, what was the total number of times exclusions were invoked?Spotlight on Success Out of all the activities undertaken by your agency since March 2013 to increase transparency and improve FOIA administration, please briefly describe here at least one success story that you would like to highlight as emblematic of your agency’s efforts. The success story can come from any one of the five key areas.&nbsp; As noted above, these agency success stories will be highlighted during Sunshine Week by OIP. To facilitate this process, all agencies should use bullets to describe their success story and limit their text to a half page. The success story is designed to be a quick summary of a key achievement. A complete description of all your efforts will be contained in the body of your Chief FOIA Officer Report.&nbsp; #> 4

August 30, ICITAP led a 30-person, 10-nation delegation at the International Association of Women Police (IAWP (link is external)) conference in Calgary, Canada. In addition to ICITAP’s HQ participation, ICITAP sponsored women police leaders from Albania, Bangladesh, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Dominican Republic, Indonesia, Kosovo, Nepal, the Philippines, Serbia, and Ukraine. The annual training conference is the biggest event in the association's calendar and recognizes the large contribution made by women in policing. The conference provides participants with the opportunity to hear from global police leaders, to share best practices and to discuss cross-cutting local and international issues. Further, the international participants have the chance to share success stories, build their regional professional network, identify points for collaboration, and gain exposure to new law enforcement techniques and methodologies. ICITAP’s investment in leadership training for women police has contributed significantly to rising levels of both female participation in police forces throughout the world as well as leadership positions held by female executives, such as former Kosovo Police Brigadier-General Atifete Jahjaga (link is external), who also served as the President of Kosovo from 2011-2016.

                                                                                                                                                                                      President Obama's FOIA MemorandumandAttorney General Holder's FOIA GuidelinesCreating a \"New Era of Open Government\"On his first full day in office, January 21, 2009, President Obama issued a memorandum to the heads of all departments and agencies on the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The President directed that FOIA \"should be administered with a clear presumption: In the face of doubt, openness prevails.\" Moreover, the President instructed agencies that information should not be withheld merely because \"public officials might be embarrassed by disclosure, because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\"Agencies were directed to respond to requests \"promptly and in a spirit of cooperation.\" The President also called on agencies to \"adopt a presumption in favor of disclosure\" and to apply that presumption \"to all decisions involving [the] FOIA.\" This presumption of disclosure includes taking \"affirmative steps to make information public,\" and utilizing \"modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government.\"The President directed the Attorney General to issue FOIA Guidelines for the heads of executive departments and agencies \"reaffirming the commitment to accountability and transparency.\" On March 19, 2009, during Sunshine Week, Attorney General Eric Holder issued those Guidelines. The Attorney General highlighted that the FOIA \"reflects our nation's fundamental commitment to open government\" and that his Guidelines are \"meant to underscore that commitment and to ensure that it is realized in practice.\"The FOIA Guidelines stress that the FOIA is to be administered with the presumption of openness called for by the President. This presumption means that information should not be withheld \"simply because [an agency] may do so legally.\" Moreover, the Attorney General has directed that whenever full disclosure of a record is not possible, agencies \"must consider whether [they] can make partial disclosure.\" The Attorney General also \"strongly encourage[s] agencies to make discretionary disclosures of information.\"While recognizing that the \"disclosure obligation under the FOIA is not absolute,\" and that the FOIA contains exemptions to protect, for example, national security, personal privacy, privileged records, and law enforcement interests, the Guidelines stress that the President has directed agencies not to withhold information merely to prevent embarrassment, or because \"errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\"Significantly, the Attorney General rescinded the October 12, 2001 Attorney General Memorandum on the FOIA and established a new standard for defending agency decisions to withhold information. When a FOIA request is denied, agencies will now be defended \"only if (1) the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the statutory exemptions, or (2) disclosure is prohibited by law.\"Establishing an Effective System to Respond to RequestsIn addition to establishing these principles applicable to the presumption of disclosure, the Attorney General also comprehensively addressed in his Guidelines a range of principles applicable to establishing an effective system for improving transparency. In doing so he emphasized that \"[e]ach agency must be fully accountable for its administration of the FOIA.\"The Guidelines emphasize that all agency employees are responsible for the FOIA, not just those who interact directly with FOIA requesters. In the past, agencies have identified common concerns that hinder their ability to provide information to the public, including competing agency priorities that pull FOIA personnel and resources away from FOIA duties, and the lack of sufficient technological support for FOIA activities. As a result, the Guidelines stress that in order \"[t]o improve FOIA performance, agencies must address the key roles played by a broad spectrum of agency personnel who work with agency FOIA professionals in responding to requests.\"The Attorney General highlighted the key roles played by both agency Chief FOIA Officers and FOIA professionals in each agency. Chief FOIA Officers \"must recommend adjustments to agency practices, personnel, and funding as may be necessary.\" The Attorney General also specifically recognized the important role played by the FOIA professionals in each agency who directly work with FOIA requesters. He stressed that these professionals \"deserve the full support of the agency's Chief FOIA Officer to ensure that they have the tools they need to respond promptly and efficiently to FOIA requests.\" Those FOIA professionals, in turn, were reminded that the President had directed agencies to work \"in a spirit of cooperation\" with FOIA requesters and to be mindful that \"[u]nnecessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the 'new era of open Government' that the President has proclaimed.\"The Guidelines emphasize the need for agencies to work proactively to post information online in advance of FOIA requests. When responding to requests, agencies are directed \"to make it a priority to respond in a timely manner.\" Finally, Chief FOIA Officers are asked to review \"all aspects of their agencies' FOIA administration, with particular focus on the concerns highlighted in\" the Guidelines, and to report each year to the Department of Justice \"on the steps that have been taken to improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their agencies.\"Net ImpactThe combined impact of the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines is a sea change in the way transparency is viewed across the government. As a result of these directives there are now:\\tNew approaches to responding to requests and to working with requesters.\\tNew, more limited standards for defending agencies when they deny a FOIA request.\\tNew requirements to maximize the use of technology to disclose information.\\tNew requirements to post information online affirmatively, in advance of FOIA requests.\\tNew focus on the broad array of agency personnel whose actions impact the FOIA.\\tNew accountability requirements, particularly for agency Chief FOIA Officers who must report to the Department of Justice each year.To implement these new Guidelines agencies must review all aspects of their approach to transparency and incorporate these principles into all decisions they make involving the FOIA to ensure that the presumption of disclosure is fully realized in practice.Starting Point: Altering the Mind Set to Make the Presumption of Openness a RealityThe President has asked agencies to renew their commitment to the principles embodied in the FOIA in order to \"usher in a new era of open Government.\" There are five key points agencies should keep in mind to realize this goal.Agency personnel must alter their mind set in keeping with the President's vision. This is the first and in many ways the most important step. To achieve a \"new era of open Government\" agency personnel must think about the FOIA differently. They must focus on the principles set out in the President's Memorandum and the Attorney General's Guidelines. Most importantly, agency personnel should view all FOIA decisions through the prism of openness.The key frame of reference for this new mind set is the purpose behind the FOIA. The statute is designed to open agency activity to the light of day. As the Supreme Court has declared: \"FOIA is often explained as a means for citizens to know what 'their Government is up to.'\" NARA v. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 171 (2004) (quoting U.S. Dep't of Justice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 773 (1989). The Court elaborated that \"[t]his phrase should not be dismissed as a convenient formalism.\" Id. at 171-72. Rather, \"[i]t defines a structural necessity in a real democracy.\" Id. at 172. The President's FOIA Memoranda directly links transparency with accountability which, in turn, is a requirement of a democracy. The President recognized the FOIA as \"the most prominent expression of a profound national commitment to ensuring open Government.\" Agency personnel, therefore, should keep the purpose of the FOIA -- ensuring an open Government -- foremost in their mind.Second, agencies should be mindful not to review records with the sole purpose of determining what can be protected under what exemption. Instead, records should be reviewed in light of the presumption of openness with a view toward determining what can be disclosed, rather than what can be withheld. For every request, for every record reviewed, agencies should be asking \"Can this be released?\" rather that asking \"How can this be withheld?\"Third, in keeping with the Attorney General's directive, agencies \"should not withhold information simply because [they] may do so legally.\" Information should not automatically be withheld just because an exemption technically or legally might apply. Indeed, if agency personnel find themselves struggling to fit something into an exemption, they should be aware of the President's directive that \"[i]n the face of doubt, openness prevails.\"Fourth, when full disclosure of a record is not possible, agencies should consider making a partial disclosure. The Attorney General reminded agencies that they \"should always be mindful that the FOIA requires them to take reasonable steps to segregate and release nonexempt information.\" Under the Guidelines, that review takes on an added element. In addition to reviewing records to see if portions are reasonably segregable as non-exempt, agencies should also be reviewing records to see if portions that are technically exempt can be released as a matter of discretion. Whether a release involves boxes of material, or only a few pages, it is important for agencies to remember that the increased transparency resulting from even a partial disclosure of records is worthwhile.Finally, agencies must keep in mind the President's directive that records cannot be withheld merely to protect public officials from embarrassment, or \"because errors and failures might be revealed, or because of speculative or abstract fears.\" Rather, agencies should only withhold records, or portions of records, when they reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the exemptions or when disclosure is prohibited by law.Applying the \"Foreseeable Harm\" StandardAfter taking all of these openness principles into account, there still will be records and portions of records for which protection will remain entirely appropriate. As the Attorney General recognized in his Guidelines, \"the disclosure obligation under the FOIA is not absolute.\" Congress included exemptions from mandatory disclosure to protect against different harms, such as, for example, harm to national security, harm to personal privacy, and harm to law enforcement interests.Under the Attorney General's Guidelines, before withholding a record, the agency must reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the exemptions. Thus, FOIA professionals should examine individual records with an eye toward determining whether there is foreseeable harm from release of that particular record, or portion thereof. Each record should be reviewed by agencies for its content, and the actual impact of disclosure for that particular record, rather than simply looking at the type of document or the type of file the record is located in.Thus, for example, a requested record might be a draft, or a memorandum containing a recommendation. Such records might be properly withheld under Exemption 5, but that should not be the end of the review. Rather, the content of that particular draft and that particular memorandum should be reviewed and a determination made as to whether the agency reasonably foresees that disclosing that particular document, given its age, content, and character, would harm an interest protected by Exemption 5. In making these determinations, agencies should keep in mind that mere \"speculative or abstract fears\" are not a sufficient basis for withholding. Instead, the agency must reasonably foresee that disclosure would cause harm. Moreover, agencies must be mindful of the President's directive that in the face of doubt, openness prevails.Discretionary ReleaseThe determination of whether an agency reasonably foresees harm from release of a particular record, or record portion, goes hand-in-hand with the determination of whether to make a discretionary release of information. Under the Attorney General's Guidelines, agencies are encouraged to make discretionary releases. Thus, even if an exemption would apply to a record, discretionary disclosures are encouraged. Such releases are possible for records covered by a number of FOIA exemptions, including Exemptions 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9, but they will be most applicable under Exemption 5.For records covered by certain other exemptions, however, discretionary disclosures are not possible because the information is required to be withheld by some other legal authority. Specifically, records protected by the exemptions covering national security, commercial and financial information, personal privacy, and information protected by statute, are generally not subject to discretionary releases. Thus, for material covered by Exemption 1, which protects properly classified information, if an agency determines that the information is properly classified, no discretionary disclosure is appropriate.Similarly, if material is required to be withheld by a withholding statute encompassed under Exemption 3, the protection afforded by that statute should be applied and a discretionary release is not appropriate. Agencies should be certain, however, that the statute being invoked meets the requirements of Exemption 3 and, importantly, that the documents being withheld fall within the scope of the statute.If material falls within Exemption 4, it is also generally protected by the Trade Secrets Act, a statute that prohibits release of commercial and financial information unless the release is otherwise authorized by law. Here, again, a discretionary disclosure of such material cannot be made if doing so is in violation of the Trade Secrets Act. Before withholding, agencies should be certain that the many requirements for invoking Exemption 4 are met in the first instance.For information falling within Exemptions 6 and 7(C), if the information is also protected by the Privacy Act of 1974, it is not possible to make a discretionary release, as the Privacy Act contains a prohibition on disclosure of information not \"required\" to be released under the FOIA. Agencies should be mindful of the need to conduct a balancing under these exemptions in the first instance and also should consider whether it is possible, given the context of the request, to protect the identities of the individuals mentioned in the documents while releasing the rest, in order to both protect privacy and to further the public's interest in openness.When reviewing documents to determine whether Exemptions 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7(C) apply, agencies should carefully review all portions of the documents to determine whether they fall within the scope of the claimed exemption. In addition, agencies should strive to reasonably segregate any non-exempt information from such documents in order to make a partial disclosure if possible.Factors to Consider in Making a Discretionary ReleaseDocuments protected by the remaining Exemptions, Exemptions 2, 5, 7, 8, and 9, can all be subjects of discretionary release. Agency FOIA professionals must use their judgment in making such determinations for each document, but they should be guided by the \"fundamental commitment to open government\" that the Attorney General directed should be \"realized in practice.\" Fundamentally, in reviewing a record the agency must first ensure that any portion being considered for withholding fits all requirements of the exemption being considered. If the exemption applies, the agency should then take the second step of determining whether to make a discretionary release of the record or portion of the record. For all records, the age of the document and the sensitivity of its content are universal factors that need to be evaluated in making a decision whether to make a discretionary release.For records covered by Exemption 2, agencies should handle \"Low 2\" differently from \"High 2\". Information covered by \"Low 2\" is, by definition, trivial to begin with, thus there would be no reasonably foreseeable harm from release, and discretionary release should be the general rule. \"High 2,\" by contrast, is premised on a finding of harm. Before applying High 2 to a record, agencies should ensure that they are not withholding based on \"speculative or abstract fears,\" but instead are withholding because they reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by Exemption 2.Similarly, for the subparts of Exemption 7 other than 7(C), agencies should ensure that before invoking the exemption they are not basing the withholding on \"speculative or abstract fears,\" but instead are withholding because they reasonably foresee that disclosure would harm an interest protected by one of the subparts of Exemption 7. As with Exemption 2, there are certainly opportunities to make discretionary disclosures for records covered by Exemption 7. For example, agencies should consider whether records which reference a law enforcement technique or procedure are now outdated, or no longer sensitive, or not specific enough to cause harm. In such cases, a discretionary release can be made. Similarly, due to the breadth of protection afforded information provided by a confidential source, records covered by Exemption 7(D) also hold potential for discretionary disclosures. Some agencies already release much source-provided information when processing records of historical significance. Agencies can review their practices in this area to look for additional cases where greater information can be released as a matter of discretion.There is no doubt that records protected by Exemption 5 hold the greatest promise for increased discretionary release under the Attorney General's Guidelines. Such releases will be fully consistent with the purpose of the FOIA to make available to the public records which reflect the operations and activities of the government. Records covered by the deliberative process privilege in particular have significant release potential. In addition to the age of the record and the sensitivity of its content, the nature of the decision at issue, the status of the decision, and the personnel involved, are all factors that should be analyzed in determining whether a discretionary release is appropriate. Documents protected by other Exemption 5 privileges can also be subject to discretionary disclosures.Thus, in response to requests for records, agencies should view each request with a presumption of openness. They should strive to maximize the amount of records released and aim to release portions of records when full release is not possible. Agencies should not withhold records merely because an exemption legally applies. For any document or portion of a document for which a discretionary release is possible, agencies should consider making such a release and should withhold only if the agency reasonably foresees that disclosure would harm an interest protected by an exemption.Achieving Transparency in New WaysResponding to FOIA requests with a presumption of openness is only one element of the President's and Attorney General's vision for creating a \"new era of open Government.\" In addition to responding to FOIA requests, agencies must look for other ways to increase transparency.Specifically, the President directed agencies to \"take affirmative steps to make information public.\" Moreover, the President stressed that agencies \"should not wait for specific requests from the public.\" Instead, agencies \"should use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government.\" This is a key area where agencies should strive for significant improvement.Agencies should implement systems and establish procedures whereby records of interest to the public are routinely identified and systematically posted. This needs to be an on-going practice within each agency. To assist agencies in applying Federal agency dissemination policies for public information FOIA professionals should consult the dissemination principles outlined in Section 8 of OMB's Circular A-130.FOIA professionals themselves can work with officials in their agency to seek out records for purposes of posting. Additionally, agencies can set up procedures in key offices where other officials routinely identify in advance, or as records are finalized, those that are good candidates for posting. The more information that is made available on agency websites, the greater the potential to reduce the number of individual requests made for records. More importantly, agencies must recognize that proactively disclosing information about the operations and activities of their agency is an integral part of achieving transparency.Working Cooperatively with Requesters and Disclosing Records PromptlyThe President also directed agencies to \"act promptly\" and make timely disclosures of information. Significantly, the Attorney General declared that \"[l]ong delays should not be viewed as an inevitable and insurmountable consequence of high demand.\"These directives require all agencies, but particularly those with a large volume of requests or a large backlog, to examine their entire approach to providing information to requesters in order to be able to respond more promptly. Certainly, increasing the amount of information made available proactively by the agency has the potential to reduce backlogs and delays. Chief FOIA Officers should be involved in reviewing their agency's FOIA operations to find areas where delays can be reduced. FOIA professionals in turn, must utilize their agency Chief FOIA Officer and keep him or her fully informed regarding the particular challenges they are facing so that the Chief FOIA Officer can make appropriate adjustments within the agency.The President also directed agencies to act in a \"spirit of cooperation\" with requesters. As the Attorney General stressed: \"Unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the 'new era of open Government' that the President has proclaimed.\" Agencies should keep these principles in mind when interacting with requesters and work to ensure that the process of requesting information is easy. One way that interaction with requesters has improved is through the use of tracking numbers for requests that will take longer than ten days to process. The FOIA now requires that such tracking numbers be provided to requesters and that a telephone line or internet service be established so that a requester can check the status of his or her request. This is just one example of how agencies can simplify and improve their interaction with FOIA requesters.AccountabilityThe Attorney General emphasized that each agency must be fully accountable for its FOIA operation. He also stressed that Chief FOIA Officers must be active participants in their agency's FOIA operations. Chief FOIA Officers are required by law to be senior level officials at the Assistant Secretary level or its equivalent. These officials are required to \"recommend adjustments to agency practices, personnel, and funding as may be necessary\" to improve FOIA administration.As mentioned above, competing agency priorities and insufficient technology support were commonly cited by agencies as concerns that hindered their ability to improve their FOIA operations. These are key areas where the Chief FOIA Officer's assistance can be vital. When, for example, FOIA personnel are pulled away from FOIA to work on other matters, or when IT support personnel are not available to FOIA professionals, these actions negatively impact FOIA administration. This is where the agency Chief FOIA Officer plays a critical role in prioritizing demands and allocating resources so that FOIA operations are not negatively impacted. As the Attorney General emphasized, FOIA professionals \"deserve the full support of the agency's Chief FOIA Officer to ensure that they have the tools they need to respond promptly and efficiently to FOIA requests.\"Chief FOIA Officers will now be required to report to the Department of Justice each year on the steps they have taken to improve transparency in their agency. This will ensure that the principles established by the Attorney General's Guidelines continue to remain vital year after year.SummaryThe President and Attorney General have established sweeping new changes in the way transparency is to be viewed and administered across the Government. These principles require agencies to employ a comprehensive approach to transparency. This approach can be summarized in ten key elements that agencies must take into account in order to ensure that the fundamental commitment to open Government is realized.\\tThe presumption of disclosure applies to all decisions involving the FOIA; agencies should keep that presumption foremost in their mind.\\t&nbsp;\\tWhen responding to a request, agencies should approach their review of documents by asking, \"What can I release?\"\\t&nbsp;\\tRecords should not be withheld merely because they fall within an exemption.\\t&nbsp;\\tAgencies should review each document with a focus on whether there is foreseeable harm from disclosure of that particular record.\\t&nbsp;\\tDeterminations of foreseeable harm are made on a case-by-case basis, but universal factors to consider are the age of the document and the sensitivity of its contents.\\t&nbsp;\\tAgencies should make discretionary releases of records when possible.\\t&nbsp;\\tWhen full disclosure of a record is not possible, agencies should strive to make a partial disclosure.\\t&nbsp;\\tSeparate and apart from the handling of individual FOIA requests, agencies should anticipate interest in records, should set up systems for identifying and retrieving them, and should post them on their website. Information about agency operations and decisions should be available to the public online. This is a key area where agencies can make real improvements in increasing transparency.\\t&nbsp;\\tAgencies should work cooperatively with requesters and respond promptly.\\t&nbsp;\\tFOIA professionals should work with their agency Chief FOIA Officers who, in turn, will be reporting to the Department of Justice each year so that each agency is fully accountable for its administration of the FOIA.Achieving the \"new era of open Government\" that the President has proclaimed will require the commitment of all agency personnel. It will be an on-going process, as agencies continually strive to integrate the new openness principles into their FOIA operations and seek out ways to disclose more information proactively. By renewing their commitment to transparency, all agencies will be a part of this \"new era of open Government.\" #> 6 Exemption 2 After the Supreme Court's Ruling inMilner v. Department of the Navy On March 7, 2011, the Supreme Court issued an opinion pertaining to Exemption 2 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b)(2) (2006 &amp; Supp. III 2009),&nbsp; that overturned thirty years of established FOIA precedents and significantly narrowed the scope of that exemption.&nbsp; See Milner v. Dep't of the Navy, 131 S. Ct. 1259 (2011).&nbsp; This guidance will discuss the newly defined contours of Exemption 2 in the wake of Milner and will address possible alternatives that agencies can consider to protect sensitive information that is no longer covered by Exemption 2.The Supreme Court's DecisionAt issue in Milner were maps and data detailing “’minimum separation distances’ for explosives’” which aid the Department of the Navy in designing and constructing storage facilities to hold weapons, ammunition, and other explosives which are stored at the Naval Magazine Indian Island in Puget Sound, Washington.&nbsp; Id. at 1263.&nbsp; A resident of Puget Sound had requested the maps and data, and the Department of the Navy had withheld them under Exemption 2 “stating that disclosure would threaten the security of the base and surrounding community.”&nbsp; Id. at 1264.&nbsp; The requester challenged the decision.&nbsp; The District Court for the Western District of Washington and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit both upheld the Navy’s decision to invoke what was commonly called “High 2.”&nbsp; See id.&nbsp; Specifically, the Ninth Circuit held that disclosure of the data and maps “’would risk circumvention of the law’ by ‘point[ing] out the best targets for those bent on wreaking havoc’—for example, ‘[a] terrorist who wished to hit the most damaging target.’”&nbsp; Id. (quoting Ninth Circuit opinion, 575 F.3d 959, 971 (9th Cir. 2009)).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court granted certiorari citing “the Circuit split respecting Exemption 2’s meaning” and it reversed.&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;In a ruling that is limited to the scope of Exemption 2, the Supreme Court then held that “Exemption 2, consistent with the plain meaning of the term ‘personnel rules and practices,’ encompasses only records relating to issues of employee relations and human resources.”&nbsp; Id. at 1271.&nbsp; Utilizing that newly developed interpretation of the Exemption, the Court found that “[t]he explosives maps and data requested here do not qualify for withholding under that exemption.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The case was then remanded back to the Ninth Circuit for consideration of the applicability of Exemption 7(F), 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b)(7)(F), to the data and maps.&nbsp; The Navy had asserted Exemption 7(F) as an alternative ground for protection of the material and that claim now remains open for the Ninth Circuit to address.&nbsp; See id.The Supreme Court’s Focus on the Text of Exemption 2In reaching its decision, the Court began by stating that its “consideration of Exemption 2’s scope starts with its text.”&nbsp; Id. at 1264. &nbsp;The Court noted that although other court decisions had analyzed the meaning of the exemption, “comparatively little attention has focused on the provision’s 12 simple words:&nbsp; ‘related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.’”&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;&nbsp;Of those words, the Court found, “[t]he key word” and “the one that most clearly marks the provision’s boundaries” is the word “personnel.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; That word, in common usage, “means ‘the selection, placement, and training of employees and&nbsp; . . . the formulation of policies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees or their representatives.’” &nbsp;Id.The Court found that using this commonly understood definition of the term \"personnel,\" the phrase \"personnel rules and practices\" in Exemption 2 should be understood to mean \"rules and practices dealing with employee relations or human resources.\"&nbsp; Id. at 1265.&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, the Court held, all the rules and practices encompassed within Exemption 2 “share a critical feature:&nbsp; They concern the conditions of employment in federal agencies—such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court went on to note that other courts “have had little difficulty identifying the records that qualify for withholding under this reading:&nbsp; They are what now commonly fall within the Low 2 exemption.” &nbsp;Id. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Court concluded by declaring that its “construction of the statutory language simply makes clear that Low 2 is all of 2 (and that High 2 is not 2 at all . . .).”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;Exemption 2 Before Milner --“High 2” and “Low 2” Under CrookerPrior to Milner, the leading interpretation of the meaning of Exemption 2 was that provided by&nbsp; the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in Crooker v. ATF, 670 F.2d 1051 (1981).&nbsp; It is from that decision that the concept of “Low 2” and “High 2” were first established.&nbsp; Under the interpretation of Exemption 2 given by the D.C. Circuit in Crooker, the statutory language was read to imply a two-part test:&nbsp; to qualify for protection the records had to be first, \"predominantly internal\" and second, either of no genuine public interest, or trivial, which was referred to as \"Low 2,\" or be matters of a more substantial nature if the disclosure would significantly risk circumvention of the law, which was referred to as \"High 2.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; See id. at 1073-74; see also Schiller v. NLRB, 964 F.2d 1205, 1207 (D.C. Cir. 1992); Founding Church of Scientology v. Smith, 721 F.2d 828, 830 (D.C. Cir. 1983).&nbsp;As the Supreme Court noted in Milner, the D.C. Circuit had fashioned this two-prong test for Exemption 2 based on language contained in an earlier Supreme Court decision in Department of the Air Force v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 362, 369 (1976).&nbsp; In Rose, the Supreme Court had rejected the argument that case summaries of honor code and ethics proceedings held at the United States Air Force Academy were encompassed by Exemption 2.&nbsp; Id. at 367.&nbsp; As the Milner Court described its holding in Rose, the honor code case summaries did not fall within Exemption 2 “because they ‘d[id] not concern only routine matters’ of merely internal significance.’” Milner, 131 S.Ct at 1262.&nbsp; Still, the Rose decision contained a “possible caveat” to that narrow interpretation of Exemption 2, with the Court stating that the narrow interpretation applied “’at least where the situation is not one where disclosure may risk circumvention of agency regulation.’” Id. (quoting Rose, 425 U.S. at 369).After this decision in Rose, the D.C. Circuit in Crooker took the caveat provided by the Supreme Court in Rose and fashioned “High 2” as a means of protecting internal matters where disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.&nbsp; See 670 F.2d at 1074.&nbsp; The D.C. Circuit reasoned that this interpretation of the Exemption “flowed from FOIA’s ‘overall design,’ its legislative history, ‘and even common sense,’ because Congress could not have meant to ‘enac[t] a statute whose provisions undermined&nbsp; . . . the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.’”&nbsp; Milner, 131 S.Ct. at 1263 (quoting Crooker, 670 F.2d at 1074).&nbsp; Over the years, the Courts of Appeals for the Seventh, Second, and Ninth Circuits adopted the D.C. Circuit’s two-prong approach to Exemption 2.&nbsp; See id.&nbsp; The Supreme Court in Milner described the effects of the Crooker decision as having “spawned a new terminology; Courts applying the Crooker approach now refer to the “Low 2” exemption when discussing matters concerning human resources and employee relations and to the “High 2” exemption when assessing records whose disclosure would risk circumvention of the law.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Notably, though, this characterization of what was historically covered by “Low 2” both omits the requirement that there be no public interest in disclosure and includes the requirement that the information be connected with “human resources and employee relations.”&nbsp; See id.&nbsp; In fact, though, many cases decided under what used to be known as “Low 2” required that the information be of no public interest, or trivial, and at the same time did not demand that it necessarily be related to human resources and employee relations.&nbsp; See, e.g., Hale v. DOJ, 973 F.2d 894, 902 (10th Cir. 1992) (withholding checklist form used by FBI agents to assist them in consensual monitoring as well as administrative markings and document notations because such records constitute trivial matters of no genuine public interest); Schiller v. NLRB, 964 F.2d 1205, 1208 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (affirming withholding under “Low 2” of internal agency time deadlines and procedures, recordkeeping instructions, directions for contacting agency officials for assistance, and guidelines on agency decisionmaking); Antonelli v. BOP, 569 F. Supp. 2d 61, 65 (D.D.C. 2008) (protecting investigatory case file numbers as internal information of no genuine public interest); Wheeler v. DOJ, 403 F. Supp. 2d 1, 13 (D.D.C. 2005) (withholding document routing information of no genuine interest to public); Maydak v. DOJ, 362 F. Supp. 2d 316, 324 (D.D.C. 2005) (upholding nondisclosure of purchase order accounting numbers that are used for internal purposes and bear no significant public interest).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Supreme Court’s Rejection of CrookerIn Milner, the government argued for the adoption of Crooker’s two-pronged interpretation of Exemption 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; See Milner, 131 S. Ct. at 1266.&nbsp; The Supreme Court, however, found that such an argument “suffers from a patent flaw:&nbsp; It is disconnected from Exemption 2’s text.”&nbsp; Id. at 1267.&nbsp;The “High 2” test, the Court found, “ignores the plain meaning of the adjective ‘personnel,’ . . . and adopts a circumvention requirement with no basis or referent in Exemption 2’s language.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;The government argued that both the legislative history of Exemption 2 and Congress' subsequent action in amending the FOIA in 1986 supported the adoption of the Crooker formulation. The Court rejected both those arguments.&nbsp; First, with regard to the legislative history of the exemption, the Court noted that at the time of the enactment of the FOIA, the Senate and the House issued conflicting reports on the new FOIA law.&nbsp; See id. &nbsp;The House Report appeared to support the \"High 2\" construction of Exemption 2 while rejecting the concept of \"Low 2.\"&nbsp; See id.&nbsp; The Senate Report, on the other hand, supported solely the \"Low 2\" interpretation of the exemption.&nbsp; See id. &nbsp;While the Court noted that it had previously weighed in on the interpretation of Exemption 2 in Rose and found the Senate Report to be “the more reliable of the two,” the Court went on to expressly declare in Milner that “the more fundamental point is what we said before: Legislative history, for those who take it into account, is meant to clear up ambiguity, not create it. . . . When presented, on the one hand, with clear statutory language and, on the other, with dueling committee reports, we must choose the language.\"&nbsp; See id. (emphasis added).&nbsp; Thus, for the Supreme Court, the legislative history of Exemption 2 does not control its interpretation since the text of the exemption is clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, in Milner the Court rejected the government's argument that Congress' 1986 amendment of Exemption 7(E), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E), to contain a \"circumvention of the law\" standard constituted its \"ratification\" of the Crooker test.&nbsp; See id. at 1267-68.&nbsp; In rejecting that contention, the Court stated that Crooker's \"High 2\" formulation was so broad that it \"renders Exemption 7(E) superfluous and so deprives that amendment of any effect.\"&nbsp; Id. at 1268.&nbsp; As such, the Court found, “if Congress had agreed with Crooker’s reading of Exemption 2, it would have had no reason to alter Exemption 7(E).”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Moreover, Congress’ decision to amend Exemption 7(E) and not Exemption 2 “suggests that Congress approved the circumvention standard only as to law enforcement materials, and not as to the wider set of records High 2 covers.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The Supreme Court’s Rejection of a “Clean Slate” Approach to Exemption 2The final argument advanced by the government in Milner was for adoption of a “clean slate” approach to Exemption 2, based on its text, that would encompass “’records concerning an agency’s internal rules and practices for its personnel to follow in the discharge of their governmental functions.’”&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at 1269.&nbsp; This argument too, was rejected by the Supreme Court as too sweeping and not sufficiently focused on the ordinary meaning of the phrase “personnel rule or practice.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The Court found that the use of the word “personnel” in terms such as “personnel file,” “personnel department,” and a “personnel rule or practice” signify “not that the file or department or practice/rule is for personnel, but rather that the file or department or practice/rule is about personnel—i.e., that it relates to employee relations or human resources.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Because the sweep of the proposed “clean slate” interpretation of the exemption would be so broad, and “would tend to engulf other FOIA exemptions, rendering ineffective the limitations Congress placed on their application,” the Court found that to adopt it would “violate[] the rule favoring narrow construction of FOIA exemptions” and this it declined to do.&nbsp; Id. at 1270.The Supreme Court’s ConclusionIn concluding its opinion the Supreme Court expressly stated that it “recognize[d] the strength of the Navy’s interest in protecting the [explosives] data and maps and other similar information.”&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at 1270.&nbsp; Significantly, it also acknowledged that its decision “upsets three decades of agency practice relying on Crooker, and therefore may force considerable adjustments.”&nbsp; Id. at 1271.&nbsp; The Court pointed out though, that agencies have “other tools at hand to shield national security information and other sensitive materials,” citing to possible application of Exemptions 1, 3, and 7 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b)(1), (3), (7).&nbsp; See Milner, 131 S. Ct. at 1271.&nbsp; Indeed, the Milner case was itself remanded for consideration of Exemption 7(F).&nbsp; Finally, the Court pointed out that if existing exemptions “do not cover records whose release would threaten the Nation’s vital interests, the Government may of course seek relief from Congress.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; It declared:&nbsp; “All we hold today is that Congress has not enacted the FOIA exemption the Government desires.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in light of the Supreme Court’s newly established interpretation of Exemption 2, it held that the explosive maps and data at issue in Milner did not qualify for Exemption 2 protection.&nbsp; See id. As the Court explained, the data and maps “concern the physical rules governing explosives, not the workplace rules governing sailors; they address the handling of dangerous materials, not the treatment of employees.”&nbsp; Id. at 1266. &nbsp;As a result Exemption 2 was not available to protect the material.&nbsp;Justice Alito issued a concurring opinion supporting the majority’s textual reading of Exemption 2.&nbsp; Justice Alito stated that he wrote separately to “underscore the alternative argument that the Navy raised below, which rested on Exemption 7(F).”&nbsp; Id. at 1271.&nbsp;Justice Breyer issued a lengthy dissent from the opinion.&nbsp; He summed up his views this way:&nbsp; “Where the courts have already interpreted Exemption 2, where that interpretation has been consistently relied upon and followed for 30 years, where Congress has taken note of that interpretation in amending other parts of the statute, where that interpretation&nbsp; is reasonable, where it has proved practically helpful and achieved common-sense results, where it is consistent with the FOIA’s overall statutory goals, where a new and different interpretation would require Congress to act just to preserve a decades-long status quo, I would let sleeping legal dogs lie.”&nbsp; Id. at 1278.The New Parameters of Exemption 2The question now is how much of Exemption 2 remains in the wake of Milner.&nbsp; As a starting point, the Supreme Court has made clear that the Exemption must be read according to its clear statutory language.&nbsp; That language provides for exemption of matters “related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.”&nbsp; 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(2).&nbsp; Thus, the old formulations of “High 2” and “Low 2” – which were based on legislative history and not on this statutory language – no longer control.&nbsp; There is now just plain “Exemption 2,” which is defined according to its text.New Three-Part TestBased on that text, and as set forth by the Supreme Court’s decision in Milner, there are three elements that must be satisfied in order for information to fit within Exemption 2.&nbsp;\\tThe Information Must be Related to “Personnel” Rules and Practices\\tFirst and most importantly, as the Supreme Court emphasized, the “key word” in the exemption and the one word which “most clearly marks the provision’s boundaries – is personnel.”&nbsp; Milner, 131 S. Ct. at 1264.&nbsp; Thus, to qualify for protection under Exemption 2, agencies must ensure that the information at issue satisfies the requirement that it relate to an agency’s personnel rules and practices.&nbsp; The Supreme Court gave several examples of what it viewed as constituting such personnel rules and practices.&nbsp; It described them as encompassing “’the selection, placement, and training of employees and&nbsp; . . . the formulations of policies, procedures, and relations with [or involving] employees or their representatives.’”&nbsp; Id. (quoting Webster’s Third International Dictionary 1687 (1966)).&nbsp; It also described personnel rules and practices as the rules “dealing with employee relations or human resources,” which “concern the conditions of employment in federal agencies--such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits.”&nbsp; Id. at 1265.&nbsp; All these examples illustrate the close connection information must have with employment in order to constitute a “personnel rule and practice.”\\t\\tSignificantly, this requirement is cabined by the Court’s rejection of the proposition that the term “personnel rules and practices” could be read to encompass those rules and practices that are written “for” personnel.&nbsp; Id. at 1269.&nbsp; The Court found that such an interpretation of Exemption 2 could be accomplished “only by stripping the word ‘personnel’ of any real meaning,” since “agencies necessarily operate through personnel.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Given that many documents generated by an agency “aid employees in carrying out their responsibilities,” the Court held that such a broad interpretation of Exemption 2 “would tend to engulf other FOIA exemptions.” Id. at 1270. &nbsp;Accordingly, Exemption 2 does not reach those rules and practices of an agency that are not themselves related to “personnel.”&nbsp; This requirement of Exemption 2, which the Supreme Court held is the key requirement for the exemption, significantly limits its scope.&nbsp; For the three decades preceding Milner, agencies focused on whether information was “predominantly internal” -- a term significantly broader than “personnel rule or practice.”&nbsp; Now, after Milner, agencies can only consider Exemption 2 for matters that relate to an agency’s personnel rules or practices.\\t&nbsp;\\tThe Information Must Relate “Solely” to those Personnel Rules and Practices\\t\\tIn addition to this key requirement, the Supreme Court made clear that there are two additional requirements for invoking Exemption 2, see id. at 1265 n.4, both of which are also directly taken from the text of the Exemption.&nbsp; Although the Court gives very little attention to these other requirements, addressing them only in a footnote, the Court states that they too must be satisfied in order to protect information under Exemption 2.&nbsp; See id.&nbsp; The first of these additional requirements is that the information at issue must “relate solely” to the agency’s personnel rules and practices.&nbsp; See id.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court defines this phrase by its “usual” meaning, which is “exclusively or only.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; \\t&nbsp;\\tThe Information Must be “Internal” \\t\\tThe last requirement is that the information must be “internal,” meaning that “the agency must typically keep the records to itself for its own use.”&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;As the Court noted, these additional requirements would typically be met for human resource matters.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; They also form distinct requirements for Exemption 2 that must be met before it is invoked by agencies.&nbsp;&nbsp; In interpreting these last two requirements, the prior decision of the Court in Rose provides guidelines that remain applicable today.Impact of the Rose Decision in Determining Whether Information “Relates Solely” to “Internal” Rules and PracticesIn declining to adopt a reading of Exemption 2 that was based on legislative history, the Supreme Court in Milner&nbsp; rejected the old “circumvention of the law” theory for protecting material under what used to be known as “High 2.”&nbsp; In doing so, the Court in Milner&nbsp; was addressing the “caveat” to its earlier interpretation of Exemption 2 announced in Rose, which had alluded to the possibility of a circumvention standard.&nbsp; In Rose itself, there was no concern with any possible circumvention of regulations or standards and so that issue was not addressed by the Court in that case.&nbsp; See 425 U.S. at 365.&nbsp; Milner&nbsp; has now disposed of the circumvention caveat, but the core holding in Rose remains.&nbsp; That holding, in turn, impacts the scope of the last two requirements of Exemption 2, i.e., the requirements that the information must relate “solely” to “internal” personnel rules and practices of an agency.&nbsp;In Rose, the Supreme Court denied Exemption 2 protection for case summaries of honor and ethics code hearings concerning cadets at the United States Air Force Academy.&nbsp; See 425 U.S. at 355.&nbsp; These summaries concerned the discipline of cadets and so would readily qualify under Milner &nbsp;as pertaining to “personnel.”&nbsp; In Rose, Exemption 2 was found inapplicable to the honor code summaries due to the “genuine and significant public interest” in their disclosure.&nbsp; Id. at 369.&nbsp; The Supreme Court “agree[d]” with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit which had found that the summaries fell outside of Exemption 2 because they “’have a substantial potential for public interest outside the Government.’”&nbsp; Id. at 367.&nbsp; The Court went on to state that “the general thrust of the exemption is simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintain for public inspection matter in which the public could not reasonably be expected have an interest.”&nbsp; Id. at 369-70.&nbsp; It further explained that the honor code case summaries “plainly do not fit that description,” and “are not matter with purely internal significance.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; at 370.&nbsp; Moreover, the Court found, “[t]hey do not concern only routine matters” and “[t]heir disclosure entails no particular administrative burden.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; As a result, the Court held that the summaries could not be protected under Exemption 2.&nbsp; See id.In ruling that Exemption 2 did not apply to matters “subject to a genuine and significant public interest,” the Court focused on the unique role of the military and the importance and significance of discipline within its ranks.&nbsp; See id. at 368-69.&nbsp; It also “agree[d]” with the Second Circuit’s conclusion that even apart from the public interest generated by the government itself concerning the workings of the Academy’s honor code, “there would be interest in the treatment of cadets, whose education is publicly financed and who furnish a good portion of the country’s future military leadership.”&nbsp; Id. at 369.&nbsp; The Court also “agree[d]” with the Second Circuit’s conclusion that this public interest “differentiate(s) the summaries from matters of daily routine like working hours, which in the words of Exemption Two, do relate ‘Solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of any agency.’”&nbsp; Id. at 369 (quoting Second Circuit).In Milner, the Court summarized its holding in Rose&nbsp; by stating that in that case it had “concluded that the case summaries did not fall within the exemption because they ‘di[d] not concern only routine matters’ of ‘merely internal significance.’”&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at 1262.&nbsp; The Court also noted that in Rose it had “suggested” that the exemption “primarily targets material concerning employee relations or human resources; ‘use of parking facilities or regulations of lunch hours, statements of policy as to sick leave, and the like.’” Id. at 1262 (quoting Senate Report).&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, in assessing whether information relates “solely” to the “internal” personnel rules and practices of an agency, it is necessary for agencies to assess whether there is a “genuine and significant public interest in disclosure.”&nbsp; When there is a genuine and significant public interest in disclosure, the material falls outside of Exemption 2 as that interest would preclude it from satisfying the requirements of Exemption 2 that it relate “solely” to the “internal” personnel rules and practices of the agency.&nbsp;So, while the Court in Milner included a broad list of examples of personnel-related items covered by Exemption 2, items such as “rules and practices dealing with employee relations or human resources,” and “such matters as hiring and firing, work rules and discipline, compensation and benefits,”&nbsp;131 S. Ct.at 1271, there likely will some records falling within these categories where disclosure will be of “genuine and significant public interest.”&nbsp; In those cases,&nbsp; the information would not be eligible for protection under Exemption 2 because it would fail the tests for sole internality.In the end, the twelve words of Exemption 2 are all given meaning in determining its scope.&nbsp; The exemption protects matters “related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.”&nbsp; 5 U.S.C. § 552 (b)(2).&nbsp; There is no doubt that the primary criterion for determining the exemption’s scope is now the requirement that the information be related to “personnel.”&nbsp; To the extent the material requested also relates solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency – which means there is no genuine and significant public interest in its disclosure, the material is eligible for protection.&nbsp; Such routine matters, while eligible for protection, are, however, excellent candidates for discretionary release under the Attorney General’s FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp;Attorney General Holder’s FOIA GuidelinesIn analyzing records for possible Exemption 2 applicability, agencies should be mindful to consider, as they should for all exemptions, Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines.&nbsp; Those Guidelines encourage agencies to make discretionary releases and to not withhold records absent a determination that disclosure would cause foreseeable harm.&nbsp; Exemption 2 has always held great potential for discretionary releases.&nbsp; See OIP Guidance:&nbsp; President Obama’s FOIA Memorandum and Attorney General Holder’s FOIA Guidelines: Creating a New Era of Open Government (advising agencies that “[i]nformation covered by \"Low 2\" is, by definition, trivial to begin with, thus there would be no reasonably foreseeable harm from release, and discretionary release should be the general rule” and further advising that “[b]efore applying High 2 to a record, agencies should ensure that they are not withholding based on \"speculative or abstract fears\"). &nbsp;The opportunities to make discretionary disclosures of material technically protected by the newly defined Exemption 2 remain as viable as ever.&nbsp; Thus, before invoking Exemption 2, agencies should ensure that they first make a determination whether disclosure of the information at issue would cause foreseeable harm.&nbsp; The Supreme Court emphasized in Milner that the harm sought to be prevented by Exemption 2 was&nbsp; “’simply to relieve agencies of the burden of assembling and maintaining [such information] for public inspection.’” 131 S.Ct. at 1262 (quoting Rose, 425 U.S. at 369). Certainly, there will be many examples of matters relating solely to internal personnel rules and practices where there is no foreseeable harm from release as there is no real burden involved in assembling and maintaining&nbsp; the information.&nbsp; Indeed, it is often more burdensome to withhold information than it is to release it.&nbsp; In the absence of harm, the information should be released as a matter of discretion in accordance with the Attorney General’s FOIA Guidelines.Possible Alternatives to Exemption 2 Recognizing that its new interpretation of Exemption 2 “may force considerable adjustments” to agency FOIA processing, the Supreme Court itself discussed the potential applicability of other exemptions to sensitive records, including Exemptions 1, 3, and 7.&nbsp; See Milner, 131 S. Ct. at 1270-71.&nbsp; Indeed, as mentioned above, with regard to the records at issue in Milner, the court noted that while Exemption 2 was not applicable, the government could still pursue on remand its argument that Exemption 7(F) applied to them.&nbsp; Id. at 1271.&nbsp; For other cases likewise in litigation, this significant change to the scope of Exemption 2 could constitute an “extraordinary” circumstance under 28 U.S.C. § 2106 (2006), which would permit the government to raise new exemption claims after initial briefing.&nbsp; See Ryan v. Department of Justice, 617 F.2d 781, 792 (D.C. Cir. 1980).&nbsp;&nbsp;In Milner, the court conceded that there might be instances where the existing FOIA exemptions would not allow for the withholding of records whose release could clearly be harmful.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; While acknowledging this reality, the Court stated that the remedy for agencies is to “seek relief from Congress” rather than from the courts.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; In the absence of such Congressional relief, for records that were formerly withheld under the old “High 2” standard, but which do not now fit within the newly defined parameters of Exemption 2, agencies should carefully consider the applicability of other FOIA exemptions to the material.&nbsp;&nbsp; A comprehensive discussion and legal analysis of all the FOIA’s exemptions, their requirements, and court interpretations, is contained in the United States Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act (2009 ed.).&nbsp; Agencies should consult this reference volume when considering the possible applicability of other exemptions to information formerly protected under Exemption 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption 1First, for disclosures that could risk harm to national security, Exemption 1 of the FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(1), is potentially available to protect records from public disclosure.&nbsp; Such protection is available for information that meets the criteria for classification set forth in Executive Order 13,526, 75 Fed. Reg. 707 (Jan. 5, 2010).&nbsp; To classify information the agency must find that its unauthorized release \"reasonably could be expected to result in damage to the national security.\"&nbsp; Exec. Order No. 13,526, § 1.1.&nbsp; The Executive Order specifies categories of information that can be considered for classification.&nbsp; See id. § 1.4. Those categories include matters such as military plans, weapons systems, or operations; foreign government information or foreign relations or activities; intelligence activities or sources or methods; scientific, technological, or economic matters relating to national security; programs for safeguarding nuclear materials or facilities; vulnerabilities or capabilities of systems, or infrastructures related to national security; or development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; See id.&nbsp; Once classified, the information must then be properly marked and safeguarded.&nbsp; See id. §§ 1.6, 4.1.&nbsp;The Supreme Court in Milner&nbsp; specifically noted that despite its ruling on the scope of Exemption 2, “the Government has other tools at hand to shield national security information and other sensitive materials,“ through, “[m]ost notably, Exemption 1 of the FOIA.”&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at 1271.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court further noted that the “government generally may classify material even after receiving a FOIA request” and so “an agency therefore may wait until that time to decide whether the dangers of disclosure outweigh the costs of classification.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, Exemption 1 is an alternative exemption that agencies can consider for particularly sensitive records that meet the classification requirements of the Executive Order.&nbsp;Exemption 3Second, Exemption 3 is another potential means for withholding sensitive information that is no longer covered by Exemption 2.&nbsp; Exemption 3 provides for the withholding of records that are themselves protected from public release by another statute.&nbsp; See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3).&nbsp; To qualify under Exemption 3, the other statute must either 1) be an absolute prohibition on disclosure or 2) provide specific criteria for withholding or refer to particular types of records that should be withheld.&nbsp; 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A).&nbsp; For any withholding statute enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-83, 121 Stat. 2184, the statute must specifically reference Exemption 3 of the FOIA in order to qualify as an Exemption 3 statute.&nbsp;Agencies should first consider whether there is an existing Exemption 3 statute that affords protection to any information that no longer qualifies for protection under Exemption 2.&nbsp; In the absence of an existing Exemption 3 statute, agencies can consider seeking relief from Congress in the form of a new Exemption 3 statute.&nbsp; The Supreme Court itself recognized that Exemption 3 offers “Congress an established, streamlined method to authorize the withholding of specific records that FOIA would not otherwise protect.” &nbsp;Milner, 131 S. Ct at 1271.&nbsp; Despite the difficulties inherent in passing new legislation, if an agency determines that certain categories of highly sensitive information will regularly be at issue in future FOIA requests, pursuing an Exemption 3 statute might be advisable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exemption 4Third, Exemption 4 may provide a legal basis for withholding certain sensitive records, providing those records were obtained from outside the federal government.&nbsp; Exemption 4 provides for, inter alia, the withholding of \"commercial or financial information obtained from a person [that is] privileged or confidential.\"&nbsp; 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(4).&nbsp; The term \"commercial or financial\" has been broadly defined by courts as encompassing any records in which the submitter has a commercial interest.&nbsp; See, e.g., Pub. Citizen Health Research Group, 704 F.2d 1280, 1290 (D.C. Cir. 1983).&nbsp; A \"person\" for purposes of Exemption 4 is also very broadly interpreted, applying to corporations, banks, and state or foreign governments, among other entities.&nbsp; See, e.g., Nadler v. FDIC, 92 F.3d 93, 95 (2d Cir. 1996).&nbsp; Finally, in determining whether information is \"confidential,\" agencies must apply different tests depending on the manner in which the information is provided to the government.&nbsp;&nbsp; See, e.g., Critical Mass Energy Project v. NRC, 975 F.2d 871, 879 (D.C. Cir. 1992).&nbsp;First, if the information was provided to the agency voluntarily, it is subject to protection under Exemption 4 if it would not be customarily released to the public by the submitter of the information.&nbsp; See id.&nbsp; Second, if submission of the information was required by the government, there are three ways in which it can protected:&nbsp; 1) if disclosure would impair the government's ability to obtain necessary information in the future; 2) if disclosure would be likely to cause substantial harm to the competitive position of the person from whom the information was obtained; and 3) if disclosure would harm other identifiable governmental interests, such as agency program effectiveness.&nbsp; See id.; see also National Parks &amp; Conservation Ass’n v. Morton, 498 F.2d 765, 770 n.17 (D.C. Cir. 1974).&nbsp; After Milner, information supplied from outside the federal government that no longer can be protected under old “High 2” may be eligible for Exemption 4 protection under the tests for either a voluntary or a required submission.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if a nonfederal entity provides an agency with the plans for a nuclear power plant or other critical infrastructure, agencies should consider whether Exemption 4 might apply.&nbsp; Such plans would likely be of commercial interest to the owners or operators of the plants or infrastructure and since those nonfederal government entities are “persons” under Exemption 4, the threshold will be met.&nbsp; If such plans were provided voluntarily to the agency and are not customarily released by the submitter, they could qualify for protection under the Critical Mass test.&nbsp; Conversely, if the plans were provided to the agency as a required submission, and otherwise satisfy the threshold elements of Exemption 4, they can be considered for protection under the third test for required submissions -- interference with program effectiveness.&nbsp; Agencies charged with regulating the safety of power plants could determine that their program’s effectiveness would be diminished if records were disclosed that could facilitate security breaches at the facility.&nbsp;Similarly, for information provided to an agency by a bank, such as agency credit card numbers or bank account numbers, such records could readily satisfy the threshold of Exemption 4.&nbsp; This information could also be considered for protection under the program effectiveness test because if an agency were required to release bank account numbers and credit card numbers to the public, the effectiveness of the agency’s programs would be undermined, as for example, by the possible fraudulent use of the requested information by the public.&nbsp;Exemption 6Fourth, agencies can consider the applicability of Exemption 6, which protects “personnel and medical files and similar files” when disclosure of the information “would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”&nbsp; 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6).&nbsp; &nbsp;The Supreme Court has previously held, based on its review of the FOIA’s legislative history, that the term “similar file” should be interpreted broadly to include all information that “applies to a particular individual.”&nbsp; United States Department of State v. Washington Post Co., 456 U.S. 595, 602 (1982).&nbsp;&nbsp; To determine whether disclosure would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy agencies must first identify a privacy interest that is at stake.&nbsp; Again, the Supreme Court has previously ruled on this point and, drawing on “the common law and the literal understanding of [the term] privacy,” held that privacy “encompasses the individual’s control of information concerning his or her person.”&nbsp; United States Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 763 (1989).&nbsp;&nbsp; That privacy interest must be more than de minimis.&nbsp; Multi-Ag Media LLC v. USDA, 515 F.3d 1224, 1229 (D.C. Cir. 2008).&nbsp; Once a privacy interest is identified, it must be balanced against any public interest in disclosure.&nbsp; To qualify as a FOIA-recognized public interest in disclosure the information must “shed[] light on an agency’s performance of its statutory duties.”&nbsp; Reporters Committee, 489 U.S. at 773.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the absence of a qualifying FOIA public interest in disclosure, the privacy interest will prevail.&nbsp; It is possible that information that previously was withheld under Exemption 2 could qualify for protection under Exemption 6.&nbsp; For example, telephone numbers and pass codes assigned to participants of a conference call could be protected under this exemption as those participants have a privacy interest in ensuring that no uninvited person is listening in on the call and there is no public interest in disclosure of such numbers.&nbsp;Exemption 7Fifth, and finally, agencies should consider whether Exemption 7 is available to protect information that no longer qualifies under Exemption 2.&nbsp; In Milner itself, the Navy’s assertion of Exemption 7(F) for the explosives data and maps at issue will now be reviewed by the lower courts.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Justice Alito’s concurring opinion in Milner, he opined that the phrase “compiled for law enforcement purposes” should be construed to encompass not only traditional law enforcement in the sense of investigating and prosecuting bad actors for crimes that have already occurred, but also preventative law enforcement and security, meaning the prevention of future illegal acts.&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at 1272.&nbsp; In his words, “[t]he ordinary understanding of law enforcement includes not just the investigation and prosecution of offenses that have already been committed, but also proactive steps designed to prevent criminal activity and to maintain security.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;Justice Alito provided specific examples of this type of law enforcement activity, such as steps taken by Secret Service agents to protect federal officials and efforts made by law enforcement officers to prevent a terrorist attack.&nbsp; Id.; see, e.g., Moorefield v. U.S. Secret Service, 611 F.2d 1021, 1024 (5th Cir. 1980) (finding that records compiled to assist the Secret Service in protecting the lives and safety of the President and his family qualify under Exemption 7).&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, Justice Alito pointed out that records not originally compiled for a law enforcement purpose, “may fall within Exemption 7 if they are later assembled for law enforcement purposes.”&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at1273.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gives as an example “federal building plans and related information--which may have been compiled originally for architectural planning or internal purposes— [and which] may fall within Exemption 7 if that information is later compiled and given to law enforcement officers for security purposes.”&nbsp; Id. &nbsp;Additionally, Justice Alito opines that “[d]ocuments compiled for multiple purposes are not necessarily deprived of Exemption 7’s protection,” since the “text of Exemption 7 does not require that the information be compiled solely for law enforcement purposes.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, he opines that “it may be enough that law enforcement purposes are a significant reason for the compilation.” Id.Agencies should use these guidelines in determining whether the information at issue qualifies under Exemption 7.&nbsp; To fall within the threshold of Exemption 7 the information must have been compiled, either originally or at some later date, for a law enforcement purpose, which includes crime prevention and security measures, even if that is only one of many purposes for the compilation.&nbsp; If this threshold is met, then the agency will next need to consider whether the requirements of the various subparts of Exemption 7 are satisfied.&nbsp;Two of the subparts of Exemption 7, in particular, are likely to be applicable to information that no longer qualifies under Exemption 2.&nbsp; First, there is Exemption 7(E), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7)(E), which protects&nbsp; records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes when production of such records “would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law.”&nbsp; This exemption has been found to apply to techniques and procedures used in civil as well as criminal law enforcement investigations.&nbsp; See, e.g., Nowak v. IRS, No, 98-56656, 2000 WL 60067, at *1 ((9th Cir. Jan. 18, 2000); Mosby v. U.S. Marshals Serv., No, 04-2083, 2005 WL 3273974, at *5 (D.D.C. Sept.1, 2005).&nbsp; It has also been applied in the context of preventative law enforcement.&nbsp; For example, some courts have allowed the protection of details pertaining to “watch list” programs.&nbsp; See, e.g., Asian Law Caucus v. DHS, No. 08-00842, 2008 WL 5047839, at *4 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 24, 2008); Gordon v. FBI, 388 F. Supp. 2d 1028, 1035-36 (N.D. Cal. 2005) (protecting “selection criteria” for lists and handling and dissemination of lists).&nbsp; Other courts have allowed the withholding of techniques used by agents to protect federal employees.&nbsp; See, e.g., Judicial Watch, Inc. v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce, 337 F. Supp. 2d 146, 181-82 (D.D.C. 2004) (approving withholding of \"firearm specifications\" and \"radio frequencies\" used by agents protecting Secretary of Commerce); U.S. News &amp; World Report v. Dep't of the Treasury, No. 84-2303, 1986 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27634, at *8 (D.D.C. Mar. 26, 1986) (protecting Secret Service's contract specifications for President's armored limousine). Moreover, prior to Milner, Exemption 2 and Exemption 7(E) were often used in conjunction.&nbsp; See, e.g., Voinche v. FBI, 940 F. Supp. 323, 329, 332 (D.D.C. 1996) (approving nondisclosure of information \"relating to the security of the Supreme Court building and the security procedures for Supreme Court Justices” under both Exemptions 2 and 7(E)).&nbsp; For such information no longer falling within Exemption 2, Exemption 7(E) alone could provide protection.Second, Exemption 7(F), 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(7(F), which protects records compiled for law enforcement purposes when disclosure “could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual” is another option agencies may consider for records no longer falling within Exemption 2 when the harm that is foreseen is harm to the safety of individuals.&nbsp; It is Exemption 7(F) that will be considered by the lower courts for the explosives data and maps at issued in Milner itself.Moreover, as Justice Alito noted in his concurrence in Milner, “the Navy has a fair argument that the [explosives data and maps] fall[] within Exemption 7(F),” given that they are used “’for the purpose of identifying and addressing security issues,’ and for the ‘protection of people and property on the base, as well as in&nbsp; [the] nearby community, from the damage, loss, death, or injury that could occur from an accident or breach of security.’”&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at 1273 (quoting Government’s brief).&nbsp; As such, Justice Alito opined that, assuming Exemption 7’s threshold was satisfied, the explosives data and maps “may fall comfortably within Exemption 7(F).”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;Agencies may at times be faced with requests for similar types of records where their concern is that disclosure could cause harm to individuals.&nbsp; If the record satisfies the threshold of Exemption 7, including compilation for a preventative law enforcement purpose, it can potentially be withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(F).&nbsp; See, e.g., Living Rivers v. Bureau of Reclamation, 272 F. Supp. 2d 1313, 1321 (D. Utah 2003) (protecting “inundation” maps that could reasonably be expected to place at risk the lives of individuals who lived downstream in areas that could be flooded by breach of dams; finding that such inundation maps were used by the Bureau of Reclamation to aid in its law enforcement mandate to maintain law and order and to protect people and property within reclaimed lands, and further finding that disclosure “could increase the risk of an attack on the dams”).&nbsp;&nbsp; But see ACLU v. DOD, 543 F.3d 59, 63, (2d Cir. 2008) (rejecting applicability of Exemption 7(F) to certain detainee photographs based on argument that release “could endanger United States troops, other Coalition forces, and civilians in Iraq and Afghanistan,” finding that the phrase “individual” as used in Exemption 7(F) “may be flexible, but is not vacuous,” and does not apply to “members of a group so large that risks which are clearly speculative for any particular individuals become reasonably foreseeable for the group”), vacated &amp; remanded, 130 S. Ct. 777 (2009) (vacating and remanding for further consideration in light of newly enacted statute affording protection to certain photographs).&nbsp;While Exemptions 1, 3, 4, 6, and 7 all serve valuable roles in protecting sensitive information that was formerly withheld pursuant to Exemption 2, it seems inevitable that there will be some sensitive records that will not satisfy the standards of any of the Exemptions.&nbsp; Indeed, Justice Breyer recognized this conundrum in his dissent.&nbsp; In criticizing the majority’s holding and its acknowledgement that “considerable adjustments” may need to be made, Justice Breyer posits the question “how are these adjustments to be made?”&nbsp; 131 S. Ct. at 1277.&nbsp; He asks what can be done “for information that is not compiled for law enforcement purposes.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; He notes that “classification is at best a partial solution,” that “takes time” and “is subject to its own rules.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Likewise, legislative action “takes time” and Congress “has much to do.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Justice Breyer, therefore, believed that “Congress’ public information objectives” were appropriately left to the courts to turn “into workable agency practice[s] and [that courts should] adhere to such interpretations once they are settled.”&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; His views, however, did not persuade the majority.ConclusionIn Milner, the Supreme Court overturned decades of judicial interpretation of the scope of Exemption 2.&nbsp; The exemption is no longer divided into “High 2” and “Low 2.”&nbsp; Rather, a strict textual reading of the exemption must be now be employed, with the key requirement being a focus on the word “personnel.” &nbsp;Only those matters “related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the agency” are eligible for protection under the newly defined Exemption 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Agencies should consider making discretionary releases of such information in accordance with the Attorney General’s FOIA Guidelines whenever they determine that release would not cause foreseeable harm.&nbsp; For those instances where there is foreseeable harm, and yet due to the narrowed scope of Exemption 2, the information can no longer be protected under that exemption, agencies should consider whether other exemptions afford protection.&nbsp; In making those determinations, agencies are encouraged to call OIP's FOIA Counselor line to discuss the matter.&nbsp; The Supreme Court’s decision in Milner represents a landmark case in the history of the FOIA, and this guidance should serve as a starting point for agencies to work through its many implications for their FOIA-processing efforts.&nbsp; #>   changed created date teaser #> 1    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 2    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 3    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 4    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 5    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #> 6    <NA>    <NA> <NA>   <NA> #>                                                                                      title #> 1                                                                  Agency FOIA Conferences #> 2 FOIA Post (2010): Upcoming Refresher Training Session -- 2010 Agency Annual FOIA Reports #> 3                                           Guidelines for 2014 Chief FOIA Officer Reports #> 4             Canada: ICITAP Promotes Leadership among Women Police at the IAWP Conference #> 5                                        Creating a &quot;New Era of Open Government&quot; #> 6    Exemption 2 After the Supreme Court&#039;s Ruling in Milner v.

As part of the conspiracy, the defendants made preparations to travel overseas in order to engage in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in either Iraq or Afghanistan. On or about May 21, 2004, the defendants traveled to Cairo, Egypt, with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.      After their return from Egypt, on or about July 4, 2004, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed discussed, sought and received instruction on firearms from another individual in Cleveland. The defendants also sought and discussed training in counter-surveillance techniques and sniper rifles with this individual. Specifically, defendant Zubair Ahmed discussed his desire to learn how to use and move with a .50-caliber machine gun.      As part of the conspiracy, the defendants also communicated with each other using code words and in a foreign language to disguise their preparations and plans to engage in acts abroad that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.      Furthermore, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed researched the purchase of firearms, methods of obtaining firearms instruction (including at least one visit to a firing range) and methods of obtaining instruction in gunsmithing. In addition, the defendants collected and distributed videos of attacks on U.S. military forces overseas, manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry.      \"Today’s guilty pleas should send a strong message to individuals who would use this country as a platform to plot attacks against U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan,\" said Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security. \"This case also underscores the need for continued vigilance in identifying and dismantling extremist plots that develop within our nation.\"      William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said: \"These guilty pleas are testament to the hard work and dedication of all the federal, state and local law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating this case and to the tireless efforts and perseverance of an extremely talented team of federal prosecutors who, with their law enforcement partners, keep this country safe from terrorists.\"      C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division, FBI, said: \"This case is an example of our continued efforts to detect terrorist planning and to prevent acts of terrorism before they occur.&nbsp; Through close cooperation with our law enforcement partners in Illinois and Ohio, this case resulted in the successful prosecution of these individuals.\"      This case was investigated by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Chicago, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio, with the assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Chicago Police Department; the Illinois State Police; the Ohio Highway Patrol; the Toledo Police Department; and the Lucas and Wood County Sheriff’s Departments.&nbsp;      This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E. Getz and Justin E. Herdman of the National Security Unit of the U.S Attorney’s Office in Cleveland; as well Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg N. Sofer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Austin, Texas (formerly of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section); and Trial Attorneys Jerome J. Teresinski and Jolie F. Zimmerman of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago also provided assistance in this case. #> 2

                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON - The Justice Department today announced that it has reached a settlement with the State of Georgia regarding the conditions at Georgia’s seven psychiatric hospitals. The Department opened its investigation of Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals in 2007 and issued findings regarding Georgia Regional Hospital at Atlanta on May 30, 2008. The Department subsequently entered into negotiations regarding remedies the State was required to implement to correct unconstitutional conditions at all the hospitals. The other state facilities involved in today’s settlement include: Georgia Regional Hospital at Savannah, Central State Hospital in Milledgeville, Southwestern State Hospital, East Central State Hospital, West Central State Hospital, and Northwest Georgia Regional Hospital at Rome.      \"When a state undertakes to care for persons with mental illness and developmental disabilities, it accepts responsibility to protect them from harm,\" said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. \"The Department commends Governor Sonny Perdue, State Attorney General Thurbert Baker, and the Georgia Department of Human Resources for their willingness to work aggressively to address the conditions at these seven psychiatric hospitals. The leadership of the State in amicably resolving this matter has been paramount to today's exceptional result on behalf of the people of the State of Georgia. We are pleased that we have cooperatively achieved a settlement agreement that will benefit the lives of persons with mental health problems and developmental disabilities in Georgia’s psychiatric hospitals.\"      Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the State will work to ensure that patients at the seven hospitals are safe and receive the care and services necessary to meet their individualized needs. Specifically, the State has agreed to undertake a variety of measures, including improving medical and mental health care and ensuring that patients are free from undue bodily restraint. The State will also improve discharge planning and ensure that each patient is served in the most integrated setting appropriate.      Today's settlement with the State of Georgia is the result of a cooperative effort by State entities and the Justice Department to reach a settlement that will make meaningful changes to improve the care and treatment of patients at Georgia’s seven psychiatric hospitals. This Administration is firmly committed to the vigorous protection of the rights of persons with disabilities.      The Civil Rights Division is authorized to conduct investigations of public psychiatric hospitals under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). This statute allows the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses such as those discovered in Georgia. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations in other in-patient mental health facilities in the District of Columbia, Vermont, and California, among other states. The Civil Rights Division has open investigations of mental health facilities in Delaware, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina and Oregon.      CRIPA authorizes the Attorney General to investigate conditions in certain institutions owned or operated by, or on behalf of, state or local governments. These institutions include nursing homes, residential facilities serving people with mental or other developmental disabilities, mental health facilities, jails, prisons, and juvenile justice facilities.      Copies of the settlement documents were filed today in federal court and will be available on the Justice Department Web site upon approval by a federal judge.

            WASHINGTON – SouthernCare Inc. and its shareholders have agreed to pay the United States a total of $24.7 million to settle allegations that the Birmingham, Ala.-based company submitted false claims to the government for patients treated at its hospice facilities, the Justice Department announced today. SouthernCare operates approximately 99 locations that provide hospice services in 15 states.      Hospices provide palliative care – any form of medical care or treatment that concentrates on reducing the severity of a disease’s symptoms – to patients who decide to forego curative care of their illness. Medicare beneficiaries are entitled to hospice care if they have a terminal prognosis of six months or less to live. The government alleged that SouthernCare was submitting false claims for hospice care for patients who were not eligible for such care.      \"The Medicare hospice benefit is intended to provide compassionate end of life care to terminally ill patients,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division. \"This settlement sends a clear message that the Department of Justice will not allow health care providers to take advantage of beneficiaries in their attempts to game the reimbursement system.\"      Today’s settlement results from two qui tam suits filed by two former SouthernCare employees, Tanya Rice and Nancy Romeo, on behalf of the United States. The False Claims Act authorizes private parties to file suit against those who defraud the United States and to receive a share of any recovery. The United States will pay $4.9 million to the individuals who filed the actions against SouthernCare.      \"Our investigation showed a pattern and practice to falsely admit patients to hospice care who did not qualify and to bill Medicare for that care. This resulted in taxpayers bearing inappropriate costs. Today’s settlement evidences the Department of Justice’s efforts to both protect the public monies and safeguard Medicare beneficiaries,\" said Alice H. Martin, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Alabama.      \"This significant settlement demonstrates our commitment to protect the Medicare trust fund from fraud and abuse and to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive quality care,\" said David E. Nahmias, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia,. \"Every provider that submits claims to the Medicare program must ensure that its services are billed appropriately. Falsely admitting people to hospice care who did not qualify for the benefit exposed these patients to potential harm and contributes to the soaring costs of health care for everyone.\"      As part of the settlement, SouthernCare will enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to address the allegations raised in the qui tam complaints.      \"Today’s Corporate Integrity Agreement contains rigorous provisions specifically designed to ensure SouthernCare’s future compliance with Medicare and Medicaid hospice eligibility requirements,\" said Daniel R. Levinson, Inspector General for HHS.&nbsp;\"This agreement demonstrates OIG’s commitment to protect the integrity of federal health care programs.\"      The investigation was jointly handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Alabama, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northen District of Georgia, the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the FBI. #> 4

                                                                                                    WASHINGTON — Executives from LG Display Co. Ltd. and Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd. have agreed to plead guilty and serve jail time in the United States for participating in a global conspiracy to fix prices in the sale of Thin Film Transistor-Liquid Crystal Display (TFT-LCD) panels, the U.S. Department of Justice announced today.      According to a one-count felony charge filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chang Suk \"C.S.\" Chung, a Korean LG executive, conspired with unnamed employees from other panel makers to suppress and eliminate competition by fixing the prices of TFT-LCD panels from on or about Sept. 21, 2001, to on or about June 1, 2006. According to a separate one-count felony charge, also filed today in U.S. District Court in San Francisco, Chieng-Hon \"Frank\" Lin, a Taiwanese former executive from Chunghwa, and Chih-Chun \"C.C.\" Liu and Hsueh-Lung \"Brian\" Lee, Taiwanese current employees of Chungwha, are charged with participating in the same conspiracy at various times during the period from Sept. 14, 2001, to on or about Dec. 1, 2006.      Under the plea agreements, which must be approved by the court, all four executives have agreed to serve a term of imprisonment, pay a criminal fine and assist the government in its ongoing TFT-LCD investigation.      TFT-LCD panels are used in computer monitors and notebooks, televisions, mobile phones, and other electronic devices. In 2006, the worldwide market for TFT-LCD panels was approximately $70 billion.      \"These cases involve the first Taiwanese nationals to face imprisonment in the United States for an antitrust offense,\" said Deborah A. Garza, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division. \"The Department of Justice is committed to holding accountable all conspirators who harm American consumers, no matter where they live or where they commit the crime.\"      During the conspiracy, Chang Suk Chung, a Korean citizen, worked as LG’s Vice President of Monitor Sales. Under the plea agreement, Chung has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $25,000 criminal fine.      During the charged conspiracy period, Chieng-Hon Lin, a Taiwanese and U.S. citizen, was Chunghwa’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Under the plea agreement, Lin has agreed to serve a nine-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $50,000 criminal fine.      Chih-Chun Liu, a Taiwanese citizen, was Chunghwa’s Vice President of LCD Sales during the charged conspiracy period. Under the plea agreement, Liu has agreed to serve a seven-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $30,000 criminal fine.      Hsueh-Lung Lee, a Taiwanese citizen, held various sales positions at Chunghwa during the charged conspiracy period, including Vice President of LCD Sales. Under the plea agreement, Lee has agreed to serve a six-month prison sentence in the United States and pay a $20,000 criminal fine.      These four foreign-based executives were charged with participating with co-conspirators in a conspiracy that was accomplished by:    Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in Taiwan, South Korea and the United States to discuss the prices of TFT-LCD panels;  Agreeing during these meetings, conversations and communications to charge prices of TFT-LCD panels at certain predetermined levels;  Issuing price quotations in accordance with the agreements reached;  Exchanging information on sales of TFT-LCD panels for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon prices; and  Authorizing, ordering and consenting to the participation of subordinate employees in the conspiracy.        \"These are the first individuals to plead guilty to a charge of fixing prices in this active investigation into antitrust violations in the TFT-LCD industry,\" said Scott D. Hammond, the Antitrust Division’s Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Criminal Enforcement. \"We will continue in our efforts to bring to justice other domestic and foreign-based executives who were involved with fixing TFT-LCD prices.\"      On Dec. 15, 2008, LG pleaded guilty to participating in this conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $400 million criminal fine – the second largest fine in Antitrust Division history. On Jan. 14, 2009, Chunghwa pleaded guilty to participating in the same conspiracy and was sentenced to pay a $65 million criminal fine.      On Dec. 16, 2008, Sharp Corp. pleaded guilty to three separate conspiracies to fix the prices of TFT-LCD panels sold to Dell Inc., Apple Computer Inc. and Motorola Inc., and was sentenced to pay a $120 million criminal fine.      The four executives are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, which carries a maximum fine of $1 million and up to 10 years in prison for an individual. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.      These pleas are the result of a joint investigation by the Antitrust Division’s San Francisco Field Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in San Francisco.      Anyone with information concerning illegal conduct in the TFT-LCD industry is urged to call the San Francisco Field Office of the Antitrust Division at 415-436-6660. #> 5 American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company today agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.415 billion for promoting its drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice announced today. This resolution includes a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a United States criminal prosecution of any kind. Eli Lilly will also pay up to $800 million in a civil settlement with the federal government and the states.Eli Lilly agreed to enter a global resolution with the United States to resolve criminal and civil allegations that it promoted its antipsychotic drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA, the Department said. Such unapproved uses are also known as \"off-label\" uses because they are not included in the drug’s FDA approved product label.Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Gregory G. Katsas and acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania Laurie Magid today announced the filing of a criminal information against Eli Lilly for promoting Zyprexa for uses not approved by the FDA. Eli Lilly, headquartered in Indianapolis, is charged in the information with promoting Zyprexa for such off-label or unapproved uses as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia, in elderly people.The company has signed a plea agreement admitting its guilt to a misdemeanor criminal charge. Eli Lilly also signed a civil settlement to resolve civil claims that by marketing Zyprexa for unapproved uses, it caused false claims for payment to be submitted to federal insurance programs such as Medicaid, TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, none of which provided coverage for such off-label uses.The plea agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay a criminal fine of $515 million and forfeit assets of $100 million. The civil settlement agreement provides that Eli Lilly will pay up to an additional $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve civil allegations originally brought in four separate lawsuits under the qui tam provisions of the federal False Claims Act. The federal share of the civil settlement amount is $438 million. Under the terms of the civil settlement, Eli Lilly will pay up to $361 million to those states that opt to participate in the agreement.Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a company must specify the intended uses of a product in its new drug application to the FDA. Before approving a drug, the FDA must determine that the drug is safe and effective for the use proposed by the company. Once approved, the drug may not be marketed or promoted for off-label uses.The FDA originally approved Zyprexa, also known by the chemical name olanzapine, in Sept. 1996 for the treatment of manifestations of psychotic disorders. In March 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short-term treatment of acute manic episodes associated with Bipolar I Disorder. In Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for the short term treatment of schizophrenia in place of the management of the manifestations of psychotic disorders. Also in Nov. 2000, FDA approved Zyprexa for maintaining treatment response in schizophrenic patients who had been stable for approximately eight weeks and were then followed for a period of up to eight months. Zyprexa has never been approved for the treatment of dementia or Alzheimer’s dementia.The criminal information, filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, alleges that from Sept. 1999 through at least Nov. 2003, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for the treatment of agitation, aggression, hostility, dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression and generalized sleep disorder. The information alleges that Eli Lilly’s management created marketing materials promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, trained its sales force to disregard the law and directed its sales personnel to promote Zyprexa for off-label uses.The information alleges that beginning in 1999, Eli Lilly expended significant resources to promote Zyprexa in nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, primarily through its long-term care sales force. Eli Lilly sought to convince doctors to prescribe Zyprexa to treat patients with disorders such as dementia, Alzheimer’s dementia, depression, anxiety, and sleep problems, and behavioral symptoms such as agitation, aggression, and hostility.The information further alleges that the FDA never approved Zyprexa for the treatment of dementia, Alzheimer's dementia, psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, or the cognitive deficits associated with dementia.The information also alleges that building on its unlawful promotion and success in the long-term care market, Eli Lilly executives decided to market Zyprexa to primary-care physicians. In Oct. 2000, Eli Lilly began this off-label marketing campaign targeting primary care physicians, even though the company knew that there was virtually no approved use for Zyprexa in the primary-care market. Eli Lilly trained its primary-care physician sales representatives to promote Zyprexa by focusing on symptoms, rather than Zyprexa’s FDA approved indications.The qui tam lawsuits alleged that between Sept. 1999 and the end of 2005, Eli Lilly promoted Zyprexa for use in patients of all ages and for the treatment of anxiety, irritability, depression, nausea, Alzheimer’s and other mood disorders. The qui tam lawsuits also alleged that the company funded continuing medical education programs, through millions of dollars in grants, to promote off-label uses of its drugs, in violation of the FDA’s requirements.\"Off-label promotion of pharmaceutical drugs is a serious crime because it undermines the FDA’s role in protecting the American public by determining that a drug is safe and effective for a particular use before it is marketed,\" said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. \"This settlement demonstrates the Department’s ongoing diligence in prosecuting cases involving violations of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and recovering taxpayer dollars used to pay for drugs sold as a result of off-label marketing campaigns.\"\"When pharmaceutical companies ignore the government’s process for protecting the public, they undermine the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship and place innocent people in harm’s way,\" said acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, Laurie Magid. \"Off-label marketing created unnecessary risks for patients. People have an absolute right to their doctor’s medical expertise, and to know that their health care provider’s judgment has not be clouded by misinformation from a company trying to build its bottom line.\"The global resolution includes the following agreements:\\tA plea agreement signed by Eli Lilly admitting guilt to the criminal charge of misbranding. Specifically, Eli Lilly admits that between Sept. 1999 and March 31, 2001, the company promoted Zyprexa in elderly populations as treatment for dementia, including Alzheimer’s dementia. Eli Lilly has agreed to pay a $515 million criminal fine and to forfeit an additional $100 million in assets.\\tA civil settlement between Eli Lilly, the United States and various States, in which Eli Lilly will pay up to $800 million to the federal government and the states to resolve False Claims Act claims and related state claims by Medicaid and other federal programs and agencies including TRICARE, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, Department of Veterans Affairs, Bureau of Prisons and the Public Health Service Entities. The federal government will receive $438,171,544 from the civil settlement. The state Medicaid programs and the District of Columbia will share up to $361,828,456 of the civil settlement, depending on the number of states that participate in the settlement.\\tThe qui tam relators will receive $78,870,877 from the federal share of the settlement amount.\\tA Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) between Eli Lilly and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that a Board of Directors committee annually review the company’s compliance program and certify its effectiveness; that certain managers annually certify that their departments or functional areas are compliant; that Eli Lilly send doctors a letter notifying them about the global settlement; and that the company post on its website information about payments to doctors, such as honoraria, travel or lodging. Eli Lilly is subject to exclusion from Federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches.\"OIG’s Corporate Integrity Agreement will increase the transparency of Eli Lilly’s interactions with physicians and strengthen Eli Lilly’s accountability for its compliance with the law,\" said Department of Health and Human Services Inspector General Daniel R. Levinson. \"This historic resolution demonstrates the Government’s commitment to improvethe integrity of drug promotion activities.\"In addition to the $1.415 billion criminal and civil settlement announced today, Eli Lilly previously agreed to pay $62 million to settle consumer protection lawsuits brought by 33 states. The state consumer protection settlements were announced on Oct. 7, 2008.\"Today's announcement of the filing of a criminal charge and the unprecedented terms of this settlement demonstrates the government's increasing efforts aimed at pharmaceutical companies that choose to put profits ahead of the public's health,\" said Special Agent-in-Charge Kim Rice of FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations. \"The FDA will continue to devote resources to criminal investigations targeting pharmaceutical companies that disregard the safeguards of the drug approval process and recklessly promote drugs for uses for which they have not been proven to be safe and effective.\"\"The illegal scheme used by Eli Lilly significantly impacted the integrity of TRICARE, the Department of Defense's healthcare system,\" said Ed Bradley, Special Agent-in-Charge, Defense Criminal Investigative Service. \"This illegal activity increases patients’ costs, threatens their safety and negatively affects the delivery of healthcare services to the over nine million military members, retirees and their families who rely on this system. Today’s charges and settlement demonstrate the ongoing commitment of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service and its partners in law enforcement to investigate and prosecute those that abuse the government's healthcare programs at the expense of the taxpayers and patients.\"\"This case should serve as still another warning to all those who break the law in order to improve their profits,\" said Patrick Doyle, Special Agent-in-Charge of the Office of Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services in Philadelphia. &nbsp;\"OIG, working with our law enforcement partners, will pursue and bring to justice those who would steal from vulnerable beneficiaries and the taxpayers.\"The civil settlement resolves four qui tam actions filed in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania: United States ex rel.

ongoing cement kiln enforcement initiative, the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of EPA, today lodged a consent decree with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California resolving Clean Air Act claims against CEMEX California Cement LLC with respect to the company’s Victorville, Calif., Portland cement plant.The settlement will resolve claims asserted in a 2007 complaint that CEMEX is releasing pollutants to the air, including nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide and carbon monoxide, without required permits setting emission limits under the Clean Air Act.&nbsp; Under the terms of the settlement, CEMEX must meet new limits for these pollutants at the Victorville plant, one of the largest cement plants in the United States, including stringent new limits for nitrogen oxide that will reduce emissions by 1,890 tons per year, a nearly 40 percent reduction.&nbsp; The cement manufacturer must also pay a $2 million civil penalty.&nbsp; EPA estimates that achieving and maintaining compliance with the new emission limits, depending on the control technology used, could cost CEMEX millions of dollars.“Today’s settlement shows the federal government’s continued commitment to enforcing the federal environmental laws and protecting the nation’s air quality,” said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.“This settlement will result in cleaner air for California,” said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA’s Air Division in the Pacific Southwest region.&nbsp; “This facility is the largest source of nitrogen oxide—an air pollutant that causes smog—in California, so the state-of-the-art air pollution controls that CEMEX is installing will have a significant impact on air quality.”The settlement resolves the EPA’s claims that on two separate occasions, in 1997 and 2000, CEMEX violated the Clean Air Act by undertaking major plant modifications resulting in significant increases in the Victorville plant’s capacity to pollute without first undergoing required regulatory review or obtaining required permits under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, program and without installing state-of-the-art emission controls that would reduce contaminants such as nitrogen oxide.&nbsp;Nitrogen oxide is a harmful air pollutant that causes smog and leads to respiratory problems in children and the elderly.&nbsp; The Victorville area fails to meet federal air quality standards for both ozone and particulate matter.The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.&nbsp; A copy of the consent decree is available on the Department of Justice Web site at http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html.&nbsp; For more information on the settlement and the Clean Air Act, please visit: http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/index.html. #>   changed created       date number #> 1    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-041 #> 2    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-048 #> 3    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-043 #> 4    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-046 #> 5    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-038 #> 6    <NA>    <NA> 2009-01-15 09-044 #>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      teaser #> 1                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Zubair Ahmed, 29, and Khaleel Ahmed, 28, both residents of Chicago, pleaded guilty today in the Northern District of Ohio to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists in connection with their efforts to travel abroad in order to murder or maim U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan. \\n\\n #> 2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The Department has reached a settlement with the State of Georgia regarding the conditions at Georgia\\u0092s seven psychiatric hospitals.
