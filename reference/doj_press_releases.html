<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 1 MINNEAPOLIS – A federal grand jury has returned an eight-count indictment charging naturalized U.S. citizens Benedict Nwana Kuah, 51, and Pascal Kikishy Wongbi, 52, with organizing, directing, and financing kidnappings, bombings, and killings in their native country, the Republic of Cameroon.The defendants are charged with conspiracy to kill, kidnap, maim, and injure persons abroad, conspiracy to provide material support or resources, and conspiracy to launder monetary instruments.&amp;nbsp; In addition, Kuah is charged with three counts of providing material support or resources, conspiracy to commit hostage taking and conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction outside the United States.&amp;nbsp;According to the indictment, the defendants are leaders of the self-proclaimed Ambazonia Defense Forces (ADF), a group of armed fighters seeking to create a new country called “Ambazonia” in the Northwest and Southwest Regions of Cameroon.&amp;nbsp; Kuah is the Chairman of the ADF’s so-called War Council.&amp;nbsp; Wongbi is the Head of Defense, Department of Logistics and Human Resources of the War Council.&amp;nbsp; The defendants directed “fighters” to kidnap, bomb, and kill ordinary civilians, government officials, and members of the Cameroonian security forces in order to coerce the Cameroonian Government into recognizing their legitimacy.&amp;nbsp; Both defendants were actively involved in planning, financing, and directing attacks to intimidate and coerce the civilian population and to unlawfully influence the policy and conduct of the Cameroonian government.“The defendants are charged with using the United States as a base of operations to finance and direct kidnappings, bombings, and killings in Cameroon,” said Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew R. Galeotti of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. “Their alleged conduct caused death, terror, and suffering among innocent civilians. The Criminal Division is committed to holding accountable those who seek refuge in the United States while spreading violence abroad.”“Minnesota is not a launchpad for overseas violence,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph H. Thompson.&amp;nbsp; “Operating from the comfort of their living rooms in Minnesota, these defendants caused violence and suffering half a world away.&amp;nbsp; They ordered kidnappings, bombings, and murders.&amp;nbsp;Their crimes are an affront to both American law and basic human decency.&amp;nbsp; Cameroon is a safer place because of this prosecution.”“The defendants were allegedly involved in planning, financing and directing violent attacks that harmed numerous civilians and government officials in the Republic of Cameroon, with targets including a market, an annual footrace, and a Youth Day celebration,” said Assistant Director Donald Holstead of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division.&amp;nbsp; “Although these violent acts occurred outside of U.S. borders, these charges should underscore that criminal actors cannot hide in the United States.&amp;nbsp; The FBI does not condone violence and will work with our partners to ensure those who engage in, or direct criminal acts are held accountable for their actions.”“The ADF used terror and coercion to torment civilians and threaten the government of Cameroon. The alleged actions of Kuah and Wongbi directed and funded that death, destruction, and terror,” said Special Agent in Charge Alvin M. Winston Sr. of FBI Minneapolis.&amp;nbsp; “These arrests underline the strength of the FBI’s partnerships across the federal government and send the clear message that the U.S. will not be a safe harbor for criminals.&amp;nbsp; Across the U.S. and beyond our shores, U.S. citizens who engage in campaigns of kidnapping, bombing, and murder will be found and brought to justice.”According to the indictment, beginning in 2017, the defendants directed and financed attacks and kidnappings in Cameroon.&amp;nbsp; The defendants sent thousands of dollars to fighters for the purpose of purchasing weapons and ammunition and directed fighters to conduct attacks that resulted in deaths.On April 30, 2022, the fighters kidnapped a civilian government official from Cameroon’s Northwest Region.&amp;nbsp; Wongbi advocated for killing the official immediately.&amp;nbsp; The fighters forced the official to read a statement denouncing Cameroon and proclaiming loyalty to Ambazonia.&amp;nbsp; Kuah then worked with others to publish a propaganda video that incorporated the statement and demanded that the Government of Cameroon release prisoners in exchange for the government official’s release.&amp;nbsp; Several days later, Kuah appeared in a video on the ADF’s YouTube channel in which he announced that the kidnapped official had been “condemned to death.”&amp;nbsp; While the official was in captivity, co-conspirators accused the official of not supporting the separatist movement and instructed the fighters not to release her until they gave the order.&amp;nbsp; The official was rescued by the Cameroonian military following a month in captivity.&amp;nbsp;Kuah later appeared in a propaganda video lamenting that the official had not been killed.In January 2023, Kuah and another leader planned and oversaw an attempt to kill the civilian governor of Cameroon’s Northwest Region, which they dubbed “Operation Rattlesnake.”&amp;nbsp; While co-conspirators sent funding for the attack, Kuah reviewed photos of the proposed attack site and the attack plan and instructed the fighters about the construction and placement of improvised explosive devices (IEDs).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;On the date of the attack, the fighters deployed the IEDs, causing the governor’s convoy to divert, but failing to kill the governor.In February 2023, the group’s leader directed fighters to bomb the Mount Cameroon Race for Hope, an annual footrace held in the Southwest Region. Kuah sent funds from his personal bank account to finance the attack and fighters sent photographs of the completed IEDs.&amp;nbsp; On February 25, 2023, the fighters detonated the IED at the race, injuring 19 people.On October 4, 2023, conspirators murdered two unarmed civilians in the market square in Guzang, a town in the Northwest Region.&amp;nbsp; Prior to the killings, Kuah and Wongbi had repeatedly instructed members to kill civilians who were believed to be cooperating with the Government of Cameroon.&amp;nbsp; After the killings, the group’s spokesman publicly confirmed that the men were killed because they had allegedly provided information to Cameroonian forces.&amp;nbsp; Wongbi then appeared in a propaganda video threatening that other cooperators would meet the same fate.On February 11, 2024, conspirators detonated an IED at a Youth Day celebration in Nkambe, in the Northwest Region.&amp;nbsp; The attack injured dozens of civilians, mostly children, and killed a 15-year-old girl.&amp;nbsp; Prior to the IED attack, Kuah distributed an operational plan for attacks, which included the attack against Youth Day celebrations in Nkambe.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, Kuah approved the purchase of dynamite, a fuse, and a remote, for use in the attack.In addition to planning and directing attacks like the ones described above, the defendants raised money and sent thousands of dollars to fighters for weapons, ammunition, explosives, and other supplies.&amp;nbsp; For example, in 2017 and 2018, Kuah and Wongbi personally sent fighters thousands of dollars to buy materials for attacks.&amp;nbsp; Then, in 2021, the defendants began to raise funds for the group through social media platforms.&amp;nbsp; Through an internet site called “The Takeover Fund” the defendants solicited donations and raised funds for weapons.&amp;nbsp; Kuah also appeared in videos on social media platforms in which he requested donations for explosives.&amp;nbsp; In October 2022, Kuah announced the launch of a new fund-raising campaign called “Operation 200AKs,” which was designed to arm fighters with AK-47 assault rifles.&amp;nbsp; Kuah appeared in multiple videos requesting donations for Operation 200 AKs, and accounts controlled by the conspirators received numerous donations, many of which specified that the funds were to be used for weapons and ammunition.&amp;nbsp; Conspirators directed members to send the funds to fighters in Cameroon, often in support specific planned attacks.Kuah and Wongbi were arrested this morning in the District of Minnesota and made their initial appearances this afternoon.&amp;nbsp; Kuah and Wongbi are detained pending detention hearings set for September 10, 2025 (Kuah) and September 11, 2025 (Wongbi).&amp;nbsp; If convicted, the defendants face a statutory maximum penalty of life in prison.&amp;nbsp;These cases result from an investigation conducted by the FBI, with assistance from Homeland Security Investigations.Assistant U.S. Attorney Lauren Roso and Trial Attorney Brian Morgan of the Justice Department’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section (HRSP) are prosecuting the case, and with assistance from Trial Attorneys Michael Dittoe and Matthew Hracho of the Justice Department’s National Security Division, HRSP Historian/Analyst Dr. Christopher Hayden, and the Justice Department’s Office of International Affairs.An indictment is merely an allegation, and all defendants are presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.</span>
