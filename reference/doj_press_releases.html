Sawyer, a former trooper with the South Carolina Highway Patrol, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Charleston, S.C., to using excessive force during an arrest.      During his plea, Sawyer acknowledged that he abused his authority as a law enforcement officer when, on May 26, 2006, he unnecessarily and repeatedly kicked the head and neck area of a man who had been apprehended in Sumter County after a chase on Interstate 95. Sawyer agreed that his conduct violated federal law and the constitutional rights of the arrested man.      "The overwhelming majority of police officers perform their duties with honor and professionalism," said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "However, if an officer commits a criminal act by violating another person’s civil rights, the Justice Department will not hesitate to step in and vigorously enforce the law."      "This is an important case, as the public places great trust in law enforcement to protect and serve them," said Walt Wilkins, U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina. "When an officer violates this oath, and the civil rights of those he encounters, the public’s trust is eroded and fellow officers suffer as a result. We are dedicated to prosecuting those who engage in abusive police conduct, and who tarnish the reputation of the dedicated officers who serve each day with honor and distinction."             The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alston C. Badger and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Alan Gray formerly of the Civil Rights Division.</span>

The firm had a contract from 2000 to 2005 with the Army to provide advertising services for the military service’s recruiting mission.      The settlement resolves allegations that Leo Burnett improperly billed the Army while developing the recruiting Web site and for advertising under the "Army of One" multimedia advertising campaign. Leo Burnett will make a cash payment of $12.1 million and credit the Army $3.4 million in work performed, but not billed.      "The Justice Department is committed to vigorously pursuing all those who knowingly submit false claims with respect to military contracts," said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division.      The settlement resolves the lawsuit filed on behalf of the U.S. government by former Leo Burnett employees, Greg Hamilton and Michele Casey, who received $2,790,000 as their share of the recovery in the case. Under the False Claims Act, private citizens can bring suit on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery obtained by the government.      The litigation and settlement of this case were conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the Justice Department’s Civil Division.      "The Pentagon’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service will aggressively pursue allegations of fraud that are perpetrated against the Department of Defense," said Sharon Woods, Defense Criminal Investigative Service director.      "The American people trust us to ensure their tax dollars are spent appropriately and we will continue to aggressively seek out and investigate those who intend to defraud the Army and the American taxpayer," said Brigadier General Rodney Johnson, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command.      The case was investigated by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Command - Major Procurement Fraud Unit, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency.      This case was prosecuted as part of a National Procurement Fraud Initiative. In October 2006, the Deputy Attorney General announced the formation of a National Procurement Fraud Task Force designed to promote the early detection, identification, prevention and prosecution of procurement fraud associated with the increase in government contracting activity for national security and other government programs. The Procurement Fraud Task Force is chaired by the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division and includes the Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the FBI, the U.S. Inspectors General community and a number of other federal law enforcement agencies. This case, as well as others brought by members of the task force, demonstrate the Justice Department’s commitment to helping ensure the integrity of the government procurement process.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 4 WASHINGTON - A former chief operating officer of Investment Properties of America, based in Richmond, Va., pleaded guilty today to conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and to making a material false statement to federal investigators, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Dana Boentefor the Eastern District of Virginia announced.      On July 10, 2008, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Lara Coleman, 40, for her role in a scheme to defraud and obtain millions of dollars in client funds held by the 1031 Tax Group (1031TG), a qualified intermediary company owned by the same person who owned Investment Properties of America.      Coleman, a resident of Houston, entered the guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Richmond before U.S. District Judge Robert E. Payne. Coleman pleaded guilty to one count of the superseding indictment that charged her with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and to a one-count information charging her with making a material false statement to federal investigators.      According to the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman and others used 1031TG and its subsidiaries in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars of client funds by false pretenses. Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code allows investment property owners to defer the capital gains tax that would otherwise be due on properties sold, if the proceeds are used to purchase new property in a specified time frame. To facilitate such exchanges, investment property owners deposit the proceeds from the sale of their property with qualified intermediaries and sign exchange agreements, which include various promises by the qualified intermediaries to clients regarding the safekeeping of exchange funds in trust.      In the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman admitted that 1031TG falsely represented that it would hold client funds solely to complete the clients’ 1031 exchanges. Coleman admitted that after obtaining clients’ exchange proceeds with that false promise, she and others misappropriated approximately $132 million in client funds to support the lavish lifestyle of the owner of 1031TG, pay operating expenses for the owner’s various companies, invest in commercial real estate and purchase additional qualified intermediary companies to obtain access to additional client funds. In addition, Coleman admitted that she lied to federal investigators about statements that she had made in 2006 to internal attorneys for Investment Properties of America about the amount of money that she and others had misappropriated.      Coleman has agreed, under the terms of the plea, to a sentence of 10 years in prison. At sentencing, scheduled for May 1, 2009, she also faces a $500,000 fine. In addition, the indictment seeks forfeiture of all funds and assets owned by Coleman that were derived from or connected to the misappropriation of the approximately $132 million in 1031TG funds.      In related cases, Robert D. Field II and Richard E. Simring have pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to defraud 1031TG customers. Field was the chief financial officer and Simring was the chief legal officer of a holding company that was set up, in part, to oversee both Investment Properties of America and 1031TG, however neither company was ever officially made a subsidiary of the holding company. Both men are also scheduled to be sentenced on May 1, 2009.      This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. Dry for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Brigham Cannon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. This continuing investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.</span>

According to the information filed along with a plea agreement, Tyson operated several RVAF plants that recycled poultry products into protein and fats for the animal food industry. As part of the rendering process in four of the plants, the company used high-pressure steam processors called hydrolyzers to convert the poultry feather into feather meal.      Decomposition of biological material such as poultry feathers produces hydrogen sulfide gas, an acute-acting toxic substance. Employees at the Tyson facilities often were exposed to the toxic gas when working on or near the hydrolyzers, which required frequent adjustment and replacement.      As of October 2003, corporate safety and regional management were aware that hydrogen sulfide gas was present in the RVAF facilities and three of the four facilities with hydrolizers had taken measures to protect employees from hydrogen sulfide gas near the hydrolyzers. However, Tyson Foods did not take sufficient steps to implement controls or protective equipment to reduce exposure within prescribed limits or provide effective training to employees on hydrogen sulfide gas at the Texarkana facility despite an identical exposure, resulting in hydrogen sulfide poisoning of an RVAF Texarkana employee in March 2002.      As a result, at approximately 1 a.m. on Oct. 10, 2003, RVAF maintenance employee Jason Kelley was overcome with hydrogen sulfide gas while repairing a leak from a hydrolyzer and later died. Another employee and two emergency responders were hospitalized due to exposure during the rescue attempt. Two employees also were treated at the scene.      "Federal laws require employers to undertake steps that limit exposure to dangerous substances like the gas that killed Jason Kelley. Tyson Foods willfully ignored these regulations and today is being held responsible," said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. "The Justice Department takes its enforcement responsibility seriously and companies that ignore these laws and risk their employees’ lives will be prosecuted."      The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requires that employers furnish places of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees. This includes taking steps to ensure that employee exposure to dangerous substances such as hydrogen sulfide gas remains within prescribed limits. Tyson Foods pleaded guilty today to a "willful violation of an OSHA standard resulting in the death of an employee," the most serious offense available to OSHA.      According to today’s plea agreement, Tyson Food has agreed to pay $500,000, the maximum criminal fine. The company also will serve one year probation.      The investigation was conducted by the Department of Labor and prosecuted by the Justice Department's Environmental Crimes Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas under the Environmental Crimes Section’s worker endangerment initiative.</span>

Filip, the Task Force Chairman, announced today.        The Task Force’s expanded roster     includes the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Reserve, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The new member agencies represent a continuing focus by the Task Force to crack down on mortgage fraud, particularly with regard to ongoing investigations into securitization fraud. The additions mark the largest expansion of the Task Force since it was formed in July 2002.        “The Task Force is uniquely suited to providing the kind of thoughtfulness and collaboration that can be invaluable in tackling mortgage fraud at the corporate level, and in trying to analyze whether and when law enforcement action is appropriate,” said Deputy Attorney General Filip. “These new members reflect the breadth and depth of the mortgage crisis that we are now confronting, and the urgency of the task before us.”      In addition to remarks by the Deputy Attorney General, the Task Force was briefed today by representatives from several of the regulatory agencies on their efforts to tackle mortgage fraud and heard from the Special Inspector General of the newly formed TARP.      The Task Force’s current members include the Assistant Attorneys General for the Justice Department’s Civil and Tax Divisions, the Director of the FBI, seven U.S. Attorneys Offices, the Secretaries of the Departments of Treasury and Labor, and the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Federal Communications Commission, United States Postal Inspection Service, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight.      Since July 2002, the task force has yielded remarkable results with nearly 1,300 corporate fraud convictions to date, including more than 200 chief executive officers and presidents, more than 120 corporate vice presidents, and more than 50 chief financial officers.      President Bush created the President’s Corporate Fraud Task Force on July 9, 2002 to restore public and investor confidence in America’s corporations following a wave of major corporate scandals. Since its inception, the Task Force has compiled a strong record of combating corporate fraud and punishing those who violate the trust of employees and investors. Prosecutors and agency attorneys who are part of the Task Force have brought charges for accounting fraud, securities fraud, insider trading, market manipulation, wire fraud, obstruction of justice, false statements, money laundering, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, stock option backdating and conspiracy, among others.

Sawyer, a former trooper with the South Carolina Highway Patrol, pleaded guilty today in federal court in Charleston, S.C., to using excessive force during an arrest.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  During his plea, Sawyer acknowledged that he abused his authority as a law enforcement officer when, on May 26, 2006, he unnecessarily and repeatedly kicked the head and neck area of a man who had been apprehended in Sumter County after a chase on Interstate 95. Sawyer agreed that his conduct violated federal law and the constitutional rights of the arrested man.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The overwhelming majority of police officers perform their duties with honor and professionalism," said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "However, if an officer commits a criminal act by violating another person’s civil rights, the Justice Department will not hesitate to step in and vigorously enforce the law."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "This is an important case, as the public places great trust in law enforcement to protect and serve them," said Walt Wilkins, U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina. "When an officer violates this oath, and the civil rights of those he encounters, the public’s trust is eroded and fellow officers suffer as a result. We are dedicated to prosecuting those who engage in abusive police conduct, and who tarnish the reputation of the dedicated officers who serve each day with honor and distinction."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p align="center"&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division and was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Alston C. Badger and Special Assistant U.S. Attorney Brent Alan Gray formerly of the Civil Rights Division.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

The firm had a contract from 2000 to 2005 with the Army to provide advertising services for the military service’s recruiting mission.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The settlement resolves allegations that Leo Burnett improperly billed the Army while developing the recruiting Web site and for advertising under the "Army of One" multimedia advertising campaign. Leo Burnett will make a cash payment of $12.1 million and credit the Army $3.4 million in work performed, but not billed.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The Justice Department is committed to vigorously pursuing all those who knowingly submit false claims with respect to military contracts," said Gregory G. Katsas, Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The settlement resolves the lawsuit filed on behalf of the U.S. government by former Leo Burnett employees, Greg Hamilton and Michele Casey, who received $2,790,000 as their share of the recovery in the case. Under the False Claims Act, private citizens can bring suit on behalf of the United States and share in any recovery obtained by the government.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The litigation and settlement of this case were conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and the Justice Department’s Civil Division.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The Pentagon’s Defense Criminal Investigative Service will aggressively pursue allegations of fraud that are perpetrated against the Department of Defense," said Sharon Woods, Defense Criminal Investigative Service director.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The American people trust us to ensure their tax dollars are spent appropriately and we will continue to aggressively seek out and investigate those who intend to defraud the Army and the American taxpayer," said Brigadier General Rodney Johnson, Commanding General of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The case was investigated by the Defense Criminal Investigative Service of the Inspector General for the Department of Defense, the U.S. Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Command - Major Procurement Fraud Unit, and the Defense Contract Audit Agency.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  This case was prosecuted as part of a National Procurement Fraud Initiative. In October 2006, the Deputy Attorney General announced the formation of a National Procurement Fraud Task Force designed to promote the early detection, identification, prevention and prosecution of procurement fraud associated with the increase in government contracting activity for national security and other government programs. The Procurement Fraud Task Force is chaired by the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division and includes the Civil Division, the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices, the FBI, the U.S. Inspectors General community and a number of other federal law enforcement agencies. This case, as well as others brought by members of the task force, demonstrate the Justice Department’s commitment to helping ensure the integrity of the government procurement process.&lt;/p&gt;  </span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 5   &lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON - A former chief operating officer of Investment Properties of America, based in Richmond, Va., pleaded guilty today to conspiring to commit mail and wire fraud and to making a material false statement to federal investigators, Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Friedrich of the Criminal Division and Acting U.S. Attorney Dana Boentefor the Eastern District of Virginia announced.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  On July 10, 2008, a federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Lara Coleman, 40, for her role in a scheme to defraud and obtain millions of dollars in client funds held by the 1031 Tax Group (1031TG), a qualified intermediary company owned by the same person who owned Investment Properties of America.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Coleman, a resident of Houston, entered the guilty plea in U.S. District Court in Richmond before U.S. District Judge Robert E. Payne. Coleman pleaded guilty to one count of the superseding indictment that charged her with conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and to a one-count information charging her with making a material false statement to federal investigators.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman and others used 1031TG and its subsidiaries in a scheme to obtain millions of dollars of client funds by false pretenses. Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code allows investment property owners to defer the capital gains tax that would otherwise be due on properties sold, if the proceeds are used to purchase new property in a specified time frame. To facilitate such exchanges, investment property owners deposit the proceeds from the sale of their property with qualified intermediaries and sign exchange agreements, which include various promises by the qualified intermediaries to clients regarding the safekeeping of exchange funds in trust.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  In the plea agreement and statement of facts, Coleman admitted that 1031TG falsely represented that it would hold client funds solely to complete the clients’ 1031 exchanges. Coleman admitted that after obtaining clients’ exchange proceeds with that false promise, she and others misappropriated approximately $132 million in client funds to support the lavish lifestyle of the owner of 1031TG, pay operating expenses for the owner’s various companies, invest in commercial real estate and purchase additional qualified intermediary companies to obtain access to additional client funds. In addition, Coleman admitted that she lied to federal investigators about statements that she had made in 2006 to internal attorneys for Investment Properties of America about the amount of money that she and others had misappropriated.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Coleman has agreed, under the terms of the plea, to a sentence of 10 years in prison. At sentencing, scheduled for May 1, 2009, she also faces a $500,000 fine. In addition, the indictment seeks forfeiture of all funds and assets owned by Coleman that were derived from or connected to the misappropriation of the approximately $132 million in 1031TG funds.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  In related cases, Robert D. Field II and Richard E. Simring have pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to defraud 1031TG customers. Field was the chief financial officer and Simring was the chief legal officer of a holding company that was set up, in part, to oversee both Investment Properties of America and 1031TG, however neither company was ever officially made a subsidiary of the holding company. Both men are also scheduled to be sentenced on May 1, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael S. Dry for the Eastern District of Virginia and Trial Attorney Brigham Cannon of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section. This continuing investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Internal Revenue Service and the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

As part of the rendering process in four of the plants, the company used high-pressure steam processors called hydrolyzers to convert the poultry feather into feather meal.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Decomposition of biological material such as poultry feathers produces hydrogen sulfide gas, an acute-acting toxic substance. Employees at the Tyson facilities often were exposed to the toxic gas when working on or near the hydrolyzers, which required frequent adjustment and replacement.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  As of October 2003, corporate safety and regional management were aware that hydrogen sulfide gas was present in the RVAF facilities and three of the four facilities with hydrolizers had taken measures to protect employees from hydrogen sulfide gas near the hydrolyzers. However, Tyson Foods did not take sufficient steps to implement controls or protective equipment to reduce exposure within prescribed limits or provide effective training to employees on hydrogen sulfide gas at the Texarkana facility despite an identical exposure, resulting in hydrogen sulfide poisoning of an RVAF Texarkana employee in March 2002.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  As a result, at approximately 1 a.m. on Oct. 10, 2003, RVAF maintenance employee Jason Kelley was overcome with hydrogen sulfide gas while repairing a leak from a hydrolyzer and later died. Another employee and two emergency responders were hospitalized due to exposure during the rescue attempt. Two employees also were treated at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "Federal laws require employers to undertake steps that limit exposure to dangerous substances like the gas that killed Jason Kelley. Tyson Foods willfully ignored these regulations and today is being held responsible," said Ronald J. Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Environment and Natural Resources Division. "The Justice Department takes its enforcement responsibility seriously and companies that ignore these laws and risk their employees’ lives will be prosecuted."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) requires that employers furnish places of employment free from recognized hazards that are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees. This includes taking steps to ensure that employee exposure to dangerous substances such as hydrogen sulfide gas remains within prescribed limits. Tyson Foods pleaded guilty today to a "willful violation of an OSHA standard resulting in the death of an employee," the most serious offense available to OSHA.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to today’s plea agreement, Tyson Food has agreed to pay $500,000, the maximum criminal fine. The company also will serve one year probation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The investigation was conducted by the Department of Labor and prosecuted by the Justice Department's Environmental Crimes Section and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Arkansas under the Environmental Crimes Section’s worker endangerment initiative.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
