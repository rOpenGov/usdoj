The Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits soliciting or receiving anything of value in return for the referral of items or services covered by federal health care programs. The statute is intended to ensure that medical providers’ judgments are not compromised by improper financial incentives.“The Anti-Kickback Statute plays a critical role in ensuring the integrity of medical care provided to federal health care program beneficiaries,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “Treatment decisions should be determined by beneficiaries’ medical needs, not by kickbacks provided to their surgeon.”“This case took nearly a decade of hard work by my office, the whistleblowers, the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services, the FBI and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office,” said U.S. Attorney Sayler A. Fleming for the Eastern District of Missouri. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office will always vigorously pursue anyone who fraudulently obtains taxpayer money and defrauds Medicare and Medicaid.”“Medical providers who accept kickbacks put personal financial gain before the needs of their patients. This behavior can harm patients and undermines the integrity of federal health care programs,” said acting Special Agent in Charge Linda Hanley of the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Inspector General (HHS-OIG). “HHS-OIG is proud to work alongside our federal and state partners to protect our programs from fraud and ensure that patient needs drive provider decisions.”The civil settlement includes the resolution of claims brought under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the False Claims Act by Paul Cairns, Dr. Terry Cleaver, Dr. Kyle Colle, Dr. Scott Gibbs, Dr. Paul Tolentino, Dr. Kevin Vaught, and Daniel Henson. Under those provisions, a private party can file an action on behalf of the United States and receive a portion of any recovery. The share to be paid to the private parties has not yet been determined in this matter.The resolution obtained in this matter was the result of a coordinated effort between the Justice Department’s Civil Division, Commercial Litigation Branch, Fraud Section, and the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri, with assistance from the FBI, the HHS-OIG, and the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit of the Missouri Attorney General’s Office.The investigation and resolution of this matter illustrates the government’s emphasis on combating healthcare fraud. One of the most powerful tools in this effort is the False Claims Act.

Bates sentenced Alex Ogando to 12 years.  Olatunji Dawodu and Luis Spencer were previously sentenced to 12 years and 12 ½ years, respectively.  All three defendants were convicted of conspiracy to distribute 400 grams or more of a mixture and substance containing fentanyl.             The Darknet operations pumped kilograms of fentanyl pills into communities across the nation over the course of four years, using Darknet markets including AlphaBay, Dream, Wall Street, and Empire to reach a broad customer base.  The defendants also used encrypted messaging services to communicate with and sell pills directly to customers.  In exchange for cryptocurrency, the defendants sold fentanyl pills that were shipped via the U.S. Postal Service to buyers in the District of Columbia and all 50 states.  The conspiracies relied on sophisticated technology to distribute and profit from a staggering quantity of pills pressed with fentanyl.            The case was prosecuted by former Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura Crane and Assistant U.S. Attorney Connor Mullin.  The investigation was conducted by the FBI’s Hi-Tech Opioid Task Force, which is composed of FBI agents, analysts, and task force partners, including special agents and officers of the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, DEA, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and detectives from local assisting police agencies. Additional assistance was provided by the United States Attorney’s Offices for the District of Rhode Island and the Southern District of Florida, the FBI’s Miami and Boston Field Offices, and the IRS-CI Cyber Crimes Unit.</span>

(“Lumentum”), pled guilty to 13 counts arising from his participation in a scheme to commit insider trading based on material, non-public information (“MNPI”) that BHARDWAJ misappropriated from his employer, Lumentum.  BHARDWAJ traded on the misappropriated MNPI himself and tipped his associates with this same information so that they could place profitable trades in Lumentum’s acquisition targets. BHARDWAJ was arrested and charged in July 2022 and pled guilty earlier today before U.S. District Judge Gregory H. Woods.U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Amit Bhardwaj, the former Chief Information Security Officer of Lumentum, ironically failed to keep the confidential information he was trusted with secure as he shared it with numerous friends and a family member in order to make a profit.  Not only did Bhardwaj betray his company and cheat the securities markets, but when confronted by the FBI, he also schemed to conceal his illicit behavior and obstruct the investigation.  Today’s guilty plea emphasizes this Office’s commitment to protecting the integrity of the financial markets.”According to the allegations in the Indictment and statements made in public court proceedings:In approximately December 2020, BHARDWAJ learned that Lumentum was considering acquiring Coherent, Inc (“Coherent”).  Based on this information, BHARDWAJ himself purchased Coherent stock and call options, and BHARDWAJ tipped three associates –– his friend Dhirenkumar Patel, another friend, and one of BHARDWAJ’s close family relatives ––and these individuals all traded in Coherent securities as a result.  BHARDWAJ and Patel agreed that Patel would pay BHARDWAJ 50% of the profits that Patel earned by trading in Coherent based on the MNPI provided by BHARDWAJ.  When Coherent’s stock price increased substantially following the announcement of the Lumentum acquisition, BHARDWAJ, his close family member, his friend Patel, and another friend closed their positions in Coherent securities and collectively profited by nearly $900,000.In or about October 2021, BHARDWAJ learned that Lumentum was engaged in confidential discussions with Neophotonics Corporation (“Neophotonics”) about a potential acquisition.  BHARDWAJ provided this information to SRINIVASA KAKKERA, ABBAS SAEEDI, and Ramesh Chitor, and these individuals all traded in Neophotonics securities as a result.  In connection with Chitor’s trading, BHARDWAJ and Chitor agreed that Chitor and BHARDWAJ would split the profits equally.  When Neophotonics’ stock price increased substantially following the announcement of the Lumentum acquisition in November 2021, KAKKERA, SAEEDI, and Chitor closed their positions in Neophotonics securities and made collectively approximately $4.3 million in realized and unrealized profits.After they were interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) voluntarily and served with federal grand jury subpoenas on approximately March 29, 2022, BHARDWAJ took steps to obstruct the federal investigation of their conduct.  On the day of the March 29, 2022, FBI interviews, BHARDWAJ drove to the homes of certain of his co-conspirators to encourage them not to tell the federal authorities the truth about their insider trading scheme.  BHARDWAJ and his associates subsequently met in person on multiple occasions and discussed, among other things, potential false stories that would conceal their insider trading scheme as well as creating false documents to buttress lies regarding payments that were, in reality, related to the insider trading scheme.*                *                *BHARDWAJ, 49, of San Ramon, California, pled guilty to seven counts of securities fraud and two counts of wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum term of 20 years in prison, and four counts of conspiracy to commit securities fraud and wire fraud, each of which carries a maximum term of five years in prison. The statutory maximum sentences are prescribed by Congress and are provided here for informational purposes only, as any sentencing of the defendant will be determined by a judge.  BHARDWAJ is scheduled to be sentenced by Judge Woods on July 11, 2023, at 10 a.m.Mr. Williams praised the investigative work of the FBI.  He also acknowledged the assistance of the Securities and Exchange Commission, which separately initiated civil proceedings against BHARDWAJ.This case is being handled by the Office’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Noah Solowiejczyk and Adam Hobson are in charge of the prosecution.</span>

Young announced today.            According to court documents and statements made in court, Canario-Batista was part of a drug-distribution conspiracy operating in Lawrence, Massachusetts that distributed fentanyl into New Hampshire. The defendant provided a stash house for fentanyl imported from an international source of supply and assisted in distributing the fentanyl to other larger distributors.  The defendant was intercepted on a court authorized wiretap arranging drug purchases from a co-conspirator who was importing the drugs. The interceptions and other evidence resulted in the execution of a search warrant at the defendant’s residence which resulted in the seizure of over 7 kilograms of fentanyl.            “This is another example of the many people needed to make an international drug conspiracy function” said U.S. Attorney Young.  “The defendant operated a critical way station as the dangerous fentanyl traveled from its international source to the New Hampshire streets. We will continue to investigate and prosecute those involved at every level of moving this dangerous drug.”            “DEA is committed to investigating and dismantling Drug Trafficking Organizations and individuals like Mr. Batista who are responsible for distributing lethal drugs like fentanyl to the citizens of New Hampshire,” said DEA Special Agent in Charge Brian D. Boyle.  “Today’s substantial sentence not only holds Mr. Batista accountable for his crimes but serves as a warning to those traffickers who are fueling the opioid epidemic with deadly drugs in order to profit and destroy people’s lives.  DEA’s top priority is combatting the opioid epidemic by working with our local, county, state and federal partners to bring to justice anyone who distributes this poison.”            “Canario-Batista played an important role in the supply chain that brings deadly opiates like fentanyl into our communities. International drug trafficking is an incredibly complex problem that can only be addressed through collaboration and we are proud to join our partners with the Drug Enforcement Administration as we work together for results like today’s sentence,” said Michael Krol, Acting Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England.            This matter was investigated by the Drug Enforcement Administration and Homeland Security Investigations.  The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Seth Aframe, John Kennedy and Heather Cherniske.###</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 5 A former prison warden was sentenced today in the Northern District of California to 70 months in prison, 15 years of supervised release and $15,000 in restitution for sexually abusive conduct against three female victims who were serving prison sentences and one count of making false statements to government agents.Ray J. Garcia, 55, of Merced, California, was sentenced following his conviction by a federal jury in December 2022. Trial evidence showed that Garcia was employed as an associate warden and later as the warden of the Federal Correctional Institute in Dublin, California (FCI Dublin), an all-female low security federal correctional institution. All three of Garcia’s victims were incarcerated and serving their prison sentences at FCI Dublin under the custodial, supervisory and disciplinary authority of Garcia when the crimes occurred.“The defendant in this case abused his authority as a warden and violated his oath to protect those in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons,” said Deputy Attorney General Lisa O. Monaco. “The sentence he received today is another step forward in our ongoing efforts to root out sexual misconduct within the BOP. This prosecution should serve as both warning and reassurance that the Department of Justice will not waver in holding accountable BOP employees and executives who abuse their authority — whether they be a correctional officer, chaplain, or warden — and in pursuing justice for their victims.”“Rather than ensuring that female inmates at the Dublin prison were safe and secure, Garcia used his position as warden to sexually abuse three inmates over multiple years, intimidated inmates and lied to cover up his crimes, and created a heinous culture that failed to protect female inmates from widespread sexual abuse and violence at the hands of other Dublin employees. The Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General will continue to aggressively investigate this type of egregious criminal conduct and we will do everything within our authority to bring perpetrators to justice,” said Department of Justice Inspector General Michael E. Horowitz.“Corrections officials are sworn to protect people and preserve civil rights — the extreme opposite of this defendant's heinous actions,” said FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate. “Garcia assaulted and harmed those in his care and custody, attempted to intimidate them into silence, and then lied in an effort to cover up his crimes. The FBI is grateful to the brave women who came forward to report these vile offenses, and we hope today’s sentence is one more step towards justice and healing.”“The evidence in this case paints a disturbing picture of a former warden who abused the trust placed in him, as well as authority granted to him, all while thinking he could get away with his crimes by lying to investigators and intimidating his victims,” said U.S. Attorney Ismail J. Ramsey for the Northern District of California. “Today’s sentence demonstrates that prison walls present no impediment to justice. The Department of Justice will hold accountable any prison official who violates their duty to protect those in federal custody.”The trial evidence established that Garcia abused inmates from December 2019 until July 2021. Garcia’s sexual abuse and abusive sexual contact against Victim 1 began in December 2019 and extended through March 2020, the abuse of Victim 2 occurred January to July 2021 and the abuse of Victim 3 occurred during the period of March to September 2020. The jury convicted Garcia of three counts sexual abuse and one count of sexually abusive contact as to Victim 1, two counts of abusive sexual contact as to Victim 2, and one count of abusive sexual contact as to Victim 3.The government’s sentencing memorandum described how Garcia also sought to deter his victims from coming forward. For example, Garcia told his victims he was friends with the person in charge of investigating sexual abuse of inmates, boasted that he could “never be fired,” and warned them that he worked for “Washington, D.C.” Garcia also instructed a victim to “get rid of any evidence” and reported falsely to another victim that a different inmate was sent back to FCI Dublin after pictures of a correctional officer were found on her phone. According to the government’s memorandum, Garcia created and perpetuated a culture of abuse. The government also pointed out that four other correctional officers at FCI Dublin have been charged with sexually abusing inmates while Garcia was associate warden or warden. The trial evidence also demonstrated Garcia made false statements to federal investigators. On July 22, 2021, Garcia was interviewed and told investigators he never asked inmates to be undressed for him and that he had never touched an inmate inappropriately. Trial evidence showed that Garcia had already asked multiple inmates to undress for him and had also touched Victim 1, Victim 2 and Victim 3 in a sexual manner.Garcia was initially charged with sexual abuse of an inmate on Sept. 24, 2021. A federal grand jury issued a superseding indictment on Aug. 23, 2022, charging Garcia with three counts of sexual abuse and four counts of abusive sexual contact against three female inmates.

The investigation was undertaken by the Tax Division as part of its effort to monitor the conduct of return preparers who have been enjoined from preparing returns for others, and to hold accountable those who violate their injunction.As the court noted, Cadet did not respond to the motion or contest the evidence against him. Based on the evidence presented by the United States, the court found that Cadet violated his injunction by continuing to prepare returns for customers and held him in civil contempt. To remedy his contempt, the court ordered Cadet to disgorge $24,410 in ill-gotten fees he received for conduct that violated the injunction. The court also ordered Cadet to pay the United States $7,386.39 to reimburse the government for the attorneys’ fees it incurred to investigate and prosecute his post-injunction conduct. The injunction barring Cadet from preparing tax returns remains in effect, and the United States remains authorized to monitor his compliance with the court’s orders.Deputy Assistant Attorney General David A. Hubbert of the Justice Department’s Tax Division made the announcement.Taxpayers seeking a return preparer should remain vigilant against unscrupulous tax preparers, including “ghost preparers” who don’t sign the returns they prepare. The IRS has information on its website for choosing a tax return preparer and has launched a free directory of federal tax preparers. The IRS also offers 10 tips to avoid tax season fraud and ways to safeguard their personal information.In the past decade, the Department of Justice Tax Division has obtained injunctions against hundreds of unscrupulous tax preparers.  Information about these cases is available on the Justice Department’s website. An alphabetical listing of persons enjoined from preparing returns and promoting tax schemes can be found on this page.  If you believe that one of the enjoined persons or businesses may be violating an injunction, please contact the Tax Division with details.</span>

Tillis was on duty as a supervisory corrections officer at the  Florida State Prison in Raiford. During his shift, one of the inmates in his custody allegedly feigned injury by lying on the floor of his cell. In response, the defendant filled a bottle from a nearby dispenser that provided water at near-boiling temperatures, then poured the scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis also failed to arrange for medical treatment for the victim, who suffered second degree burns on his chest as a result of this assault.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "It is important that corrections officers realize they may not use their positions of authority to inflict physical harm on inmates as punishment," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King for the Civil Rights Division. "While the vast majority of law enforcement officers carry out their difficult duties in a lawful and professional manner, the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute those who cross the line and commit this type of unlawful act."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Tillis faces a maximum punishment of ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled by the court.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  This case was investigated by agents from the FBI’s Jacksonville Division and the Florida Office of the Inspector General. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mac Heavener of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida and Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Douglas Kern.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The Civil Rights Division is committed to the vigorous enforcement of every federal criminal civil rights statute, such as those laws that prohibit the willful use of excessive force or other acts of misconduct by law enforcement and other government officials. In FY2008, the Criminal Section filed the largest-ever number of federal criminal civil rights cases in a single year in the Section’s history, and the second-highest ever number of official misconduct prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez announced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;De Castro Font pleaded guilty to devising and engaging in a scheme that deprived the people of Puerto Rico of his honest services as a legislator, performed free from conflict of interest, concealment and improper influence. De Castro Font also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion through fear of economic harm and under color of official right. De Castro Font was indicted for these and other related offenses on Oct. 2, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;De Castro Font entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Francisco Augusto Besosa in the District of Puerto Rico. De Castro Font admitted that from Jan. 2, 2005, through August 2008, he directly and indirectly solicited between approximately $500,000 and $525,000 in cash payments and other benefits, such as campaign contributions in excess of the legal limits, lodging, private flights, meals and other things of value, from individuals. De Castro Font admitted that he engaged in official acts on behalf of some of these individuals who had provided him with these undisclosed benefits, including but not limited to, proposing legislation, preventing legislative projects to be voted or acted upon, and persuading other legislators to vote for or against legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;De Castro Font also admitted to participating in a conspiracy to obtain cash and other benefits from five individuals whom he admitted he knew felt that if they did not provide him with the financial benefits requested, De Castro Font could use his official position to harm their financial interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Judge Besosa scheduled a sentencing hearing on Apr. 23, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;"Using an elected office for personal gain denies citizens the honest services of their elected leaders," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin. "The Department will continue to identify and prosecute public officials who corruptly use their position and influence to illegally benefit themselves."&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;"Senator De Castro Font has accepted responsibility for the acts of public corruption charged in the indictment. His conduct was an affront to the voters of Puerto Rico who placed their trust and confidence in him and the institution that he represented, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. His blatant disregard for his oath of office and his breach of the public trust, for his personal enrichment, violated the very essence of our democratic government. We will continue our public corruption investigations against public officials and those who make illegal payments in exchange for official acts," said U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;"Let this conviction send a stark message to all public servants that the sale of influence and public corruption will not be tolerated by the FBI or the law-abiding citizens of Puerto Rico," said Luis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI-San Juan Field Office.  "The FBI will continue to be vigilant so as to root out all public corruption.  As I have said before, corruption affects every facet of society: the people, honest businessmen, education and public works."&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 4, 2008, Alberto Goachet, a political consultant and aide to De Castro Font, pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to launder illegal campaign contributions and other payments.  Goachet admitted that he and others laundered the money through the use of fake invoices purporting to reflect legitimate payments to a political consulting firm owned by Goachet. Goachet admitted that the false invoices were meant to conceal a businessman’s illegal payments to De Castro Font. Goachet also admitted that in August 2008 he falsely claimed in an interview with the FBI that the invoices were legitimately written for services rendered to the businessman and denied that the money was intended for De Castro Font.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacqueline Novas and Timothy R. Henwood of the District of Puerto Rico, and Trial Attorney Matthew L. Stennes of the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section. The case was investigated by the FBI’s San Juan Field Office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Factual Basis&lt;/p&gt;\n</span>

Breuer de la División de lo Penal; el Fiscal Federal Wifredo A. Ferrer del Distrito Sur de Florida; y Daniel W. Auer, Agente Especial a Cargo del Servicio de Impuestos Internos, Oficina Local de Miami de Investigaciones Penales (IRS-CI).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Antonio Perez, 52, de Miami, también fue condenado por el Juez Federal de Distrito Jose E. Martinez a dos años de libertad bajo supervisión después de haber cumplido su sentencia en prisión, y a entregar $36,375 al gobierno. Perez se declaró culpable el 27 de abril de 2009, de conspirar para realizar pagos corruptos para una compañía de telecomunicaciones del Condado de Miami-Dade a funcionarios de la compañía de telecomunicaciones estatal de la República de Haití, Telecommunications D'Haiti, en violación de la Ley de Prácticas Corruptas en el Extranjero (FCPA) y leyes de lavado de dinero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;En su declaración de culpabilidad, Perez admitió haber conspirado para realizar pagos corruptos a funcionarios gubernamentales extranjeros con la finalidad de obtener ventajas comerciales para la empresa de telecomunicaciones por parte de Telecommunications D'Haiti. De acuerdo con el expediente judicial, Perez conspiró con Robert Antoine, el ex director de relaciones internacionales para Telecommunications D'Haiti y Juan Diaz, el propietario de J.D. Locator Services, junto con otros. Perez y sus coconspiradores ocultaros los pagos de sobornos en parte al conducir transacciones financieras en las que se realizaron transferencias telegráficas de dinero a empresas fantasma y a través de denominaciones falsas en facturas, cheques y libros contables. Perez admitió que él mismo estuvo involucrado en dos pagos de sobornos por un total de aproximadamente 36,375 dólares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;El 30 de julio de 2010, Diaz fue sentenciado a 57 meses en prisión después de haberse declarado culpable de pagar y ocultar 1,028,851 dólares en sobornos a ex funcionarios del gobierno de Haití mientras actuaba como intermediario para tres empresas privadas de telecomunicaciones. Antoine admitió que aceptó los sobornos, incluidos sobornos de Diaz, y se declaró culpable el 12 de marzo de 2010 a conspiración para cometer lavado de dinero. Antoine fue sentenciado a cuatro años en prisión.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joel Esquenazi y Carlos Rodriguez, los propietarios de la empresa de telecomunicaciones en la que trabajaba Perez, así como Jean Rene Duperval, quien fue director de relaciones internacionales de Telecommunications D´'Haiti de junio de 2003 a abril de 2004, y la hermana de Duperval, Marguerite Grandison, fueron acusados formalmente junto con Antoine, el 4 de diciembre de 2009. El enjuiciamiento de los demás demandados tiene su inicio programado para el 28 de febrero de 2011 en el Tribunal Federal de Distrito en Miami. Una acusación formal es apenas una acusación, y se supone que los demandados son inocentes hasta que se pruebe lo contrario más allá de la duda razonable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;El Departamento de Justicia agradece al gobierno de Haití por su importante asistencia en recabar pruebas durante esta investigación. En particular, la unidad de inteligencia financiera de Haiti, la Unite Centrale de Renseignements Financiers, el Bureau des Affaires Financieres et Economiques, el cual es un componente especializado de la Policía Nacional Haitiana, y el Ministerio de Justicia y Seguridad Pública brindar importante cooperación y coordinación en la investigación.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Están a cargo de la acusación en el caso la Fiscal Federal Auxiliar Aurora Fagan de la Fiscalía Federal para el Distrito Sur de Florida, la Abogada Litigante Sénior Nicola J. Mrazek de la Sección de Fraude de la División de lo Penal y el Abogado Litigante Kevin Gerrity de la Sección de Confiscación de Activos y Lavado de Dinero de la División de lo Penal. La Oficina de Asuntos Internacionales de la División de lo Penal también brindó asistencia en este asunto. El caso fue investigado por la Oficina Local de Miami del IRS-CI.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n</span>

(LAN Cargo), Aerolinhas Brasileiras S.A. (ABSA), and EL AL Israel Airlines Ltd. (EL AL), have each agreed to plead guilty and pay criminal fines totaling $124.7 million for their roles in a conspiracy to fix prices in the air cargo industry, the Department of Justice announced today. Under the plea agreements, LAN Cargo, a Chilean company, and ABSA, a Brazilian company that is substantially owned by LAN Cargo, have agreed to pay a single criminal fine of $109 million. EL AL, an Israeli company, has agreed to pay a criminal fine of $15.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Including today’s charges, a total of 12 airlines and three executives have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in the Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into price fixing in the air transportation industry. To date, more than $1 billion in criminal fines have been imposed and executives have been sentenced to serve a total of 20 months in jail.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to the charges filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, each airline engaged in a conspiracy in the United States and elsewhere to eliminate competition by fixing the cargo rates charged to customers for international air shipments, including to and from the United States. LAN Cargo and ABSA are charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about February 2003 and continuing until at least Feb. 14, 2006. EL AL is charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about January 2003 until at least Feb. 14, 2006. The plea agreements are subject to court approval. Each airline has agreed to cooperate with the Department’s ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "American consumers were forced to pay higher prices on the goods they buy every day as a result of the inflated and collusive shipping rates charged by these companies," said Scott D. Hammond, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Antitrust Division.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  LAN Cargo, ABSA and EL AL are charged with carrying out the price-fixing conspiracy with co-conspirators by:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere to discuss the cargo rates to be charged on certain routes to and from the United States;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Agreeing, during those meetings, conversations and communications on certain components of the cargo rates to charge for shipments on certain routes to and from the United States; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Levying cargo rates in the United States and elsewhere in accordance with the agreements reached; and&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Engaging in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon cargo rates.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The nine airlines that have pleaded guilty to date as a result of the Department’s ongoing investigation into the air transportation industry are: British Airways Plc (British Airways), Korean Air Lines Ltd., Qantas Airways Limited (Qantas), Japan Airlines International Co. Ltd., Martinair Holland N.V., Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, SAS Cargo Group A/S (SAS), Société Air France and Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. (KLM Royal Dutch Airlines). The three airline executives who have pleaded guilty for their involvement in the illegal activity are Bruce McCaffrey of Qantas, Timothy Pfeil of SAS and Keith Packer of British Airways.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  EL AL, LAN Cargo and ABSA are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, a violation which carries a maximum sentence of $100 million for corporations. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The ongoing investigation is being conducted by the Antitrust Division’s National Criminal Enforcement Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

Grant, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office announced.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  William Cozzi, 51, pleaded guilty to a one-count information in U.S. District Court in Chicago, admitting he used excessive or unreasonable force while acting under color of law. Cozzi joined the Chicago Police Department in 1992 and was assigned to the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; District at the time of the alleged incident. He was subsequently suspended from duty. Cozzi was indicted in April 2008 for depriving the victim of his civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  On Aug. 2, 2005, while performing his duties as a police officer, Cozzi admitted that he used a "sap," a dangerous weapon similar to a blackjack, to repeatedly strike the victim who was handcuffed and shackled in a wheelchair at Norwegian American Hospital, resulting in bodily injury. At the time, the victim was awaiting treatment in the hospital emergency room after being stabbed in the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The defendant violated the public trust by abusing his law enforcement authority," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King.  "This prosecution demonstrates that the Civil Rights Division is committed to aggressively prosecuting law enforcement officers who willfully use excessive force."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "No law enforcement officer may use unreasonable force with impunity and every citizen, regardless of being in police custody, has a constitutional right to be free from the use of excessive force," U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Cozzi pleaded guilty while reserving his right to appeal a ruling last year denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the prosecution was based in part on compelled statements he made to the Chicago Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards and during a police review board hearing.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to a plea agreement, Cozzi was dispatched to the hospital to respond to the stabbing and approached the victim who was being loud and verbally abusive while awaiting treatment for the stabbing. Shortly after approaching the victim, Cozzi placed him in handcuffs and left the emergency room to retrieve leg shackles, which he then placed on the victim. With the victim restrained, Cozzi used a sap to repeatedly strike him in the face and body. According to the plea agreement, at the time of the assault the victim posed no physical threat to Cozzi or anyone else at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Cozzi also admitted that he subsequently prepared a false arrest report and misdemeanor complaints stating that the victim attempted to punch him and two hospital security guards, as well as a false tactical response report stating that he used an "open hand strike" on the victim but omitted that he struck the victim with a sap.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning set sentencing for March 26, 2009. Cozzi faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Drury from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 6   &lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON – Phat Ngoc Tran, 35, pleaded guilty today in San Diego to conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, the "Tran Organization," in a scheme to cheat at least 12 casinos across the United States and Canada out of millions of dollars, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen P. Hewitt for the Southern District of California announced today. Tran admitted that he and his co-conspirators unlawfully obtained up to $2.5 million during card cheats.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  A three-count indictment was returned May 22, 2007, and unsealed in the Southern District of California on May 24, 2007, charging Tran and 13 others each with one count of conspiracy to participate in the affairs of a racketeering enterprise; one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The indictment also charged five separate individuals each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  In his plea agreement, Tran admitted that on numerous occasions between approximately October 2002 and July 2006, he participated in gambling cheats together with other alleged members of the Tran Organization at casinos in the United States and Canada. Tran admitted to targeting at least 12 casinos in the racketeering conspiracy, including:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beau Rivage Casino, in Biloxi, Miss.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario, Canada;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Gold Strike Casino in Tunica, Miss.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Horseshoe Casino, in Bossier City, La.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Horseshoe Casino and Hotel, in Tunica, Miss.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Isle of Capri Casino, in Westlake, La.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Majestic Star Casino, in Gary, Ind.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mohegan Sun Resort Casino, in Uncasville, Conn.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Palace Station Casino, in Las Vegas, Nev.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Resorts East Chicago Hotel and Casino, in East Chicago, Ind.; and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sycuan Casino, in El Cajon, Calif.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;  According to the indictment, the defendants and others executed a "false shuffle" cheating scheme at casinos in the United States and Canada during blackjack and mini-baccarat games. The indictment alleges that members of the criminal organization bribed casino card dealers and supervisors to perform false shuffles during card games, thereby creating "slugs" or groups, of un-shuffled cards. The indictment also alleges that after tracking the order of cards dealt in a card game, a member of the organization would signal to the card dealer to perform a "false shuffle," and members of the group would then bet on the known order of cards when the slug appeared on the table. By doing so, members of the conspiracy repeatedly won thousands of dollars during card games, including winning up to $868,000 on one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The indictment also alleges that the members of the organization used sophisticated mechanisms for tracking the order of cards during games, including hidden transmitter devices and specially created software that would predict the order in which cards would reappear during mini-baccarat and blackjack games.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Tran’s sentencing is scheduled for June 1, 2009, in San Diego before U.S. District Judge John A. Houston. At sentencing, Tran faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the racketeering conspiracy charge. Tran agreed to a personal money judgment in the amount of $180,000, which will be entered by way of a preliminary order of forfeiture. He also acknowledged that the restitution that he may be ordered to pay by the court at sentencing is not limited by the forfeiture amount. Tran was also charged in Orillia, Ontario, Canada, for his admitted cheating activities at Casino Rama.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  A second indictment has alleged that 11 additional defendants conspired to commit offenses on behalf of the Tran Organization. A one-count indictment, unsealed in the Southern District of California on Sept. 11, 2008, charged Bryan Arce; Don Man Duong; Hogan Ho; Thang Viet Huynh; Outtama Keovongsa; Leap Kong, a/k/a Lanida Kong; Qua Le; Khunsela Prom, a/k/a Danny Prom; James Root; Darrell Saicocie; and Dan Thich each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos, and conspiracy to travel in interstate and foreign commerce in aid of racketeering.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  To date, 20 defendants, including Tran, have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the casino-cheating conspiracy: Phuong Quoc Truong; Anh Phuong Tran; Martin Lee Aronson; Liem Thanh Lam; George Michael Lee; Tien Duc Vu; Son Hong Johnson; Barry Wellford; Willy Tran; Tuan Mong Le; Duc Cong Nguyen; Han Truong Nguyen; Roderick Vang Thor; Sisouvanh Mounlasy; Navin Nith; Renee Cuc Quang; Ui Suk Weller; Phally Ly; and Khunsela Prom. These defendants admitted to targeting, with the aid of coconspirators, a combined total of approximately 24 casinos during the course of the conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The case is being investigated by the FBI’s San Diego Field Office; the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation; the San Diego Sheriff’s Department; and the California Department of Justice’s Bureau of Gambling Control. The investigation has received assistance from federal, state, tribal and foreign authorities, including: the Ontario Provincial Police; the National Indian Gaming Commission; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington; FBI Resident Agencies in Gulfport, Miss., Tacoma, Wash., and Toledo, Ohio; the Indiana State Police; the Rumsey Rancheria Tribal Gaming Agency; the Sycuan Gaming Commission; the Barona Gaming Commission; the Mississippi Gaming Commission; and the Washington State Gambling Commission.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The prosecution of the case is led by the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section (OCRS). Department of Justice Trial Attorneys Joseph K. Wheatley, Robert S. Tully and Gavin A. Corn are prosecuting the indictment in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
