Burgess on Tuesday, March 28. John Daniel Brooks had previously pleaded guilty to one count of Distribution and Receipt of Child Pornography.In September of 2021, the State of Alaska contacted the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Anchorage to report that a state employee was suspected of possessing images depicting child sexual exploitation. Two days later, the FBI conducted a search warrant at Brooks’ residence, where he worked for the state of Alaska remotely as an analyst programmer.The FBI discovered that Brooks had installed an internal hard drive in his State of Alaska computer that was found to contain over 1.2 million images of suspected child exploitation. Those images included depictions of infants and toddlers being tortured and sexually assaulted by adults. All told, Brooks’ collection of child exploitation materials was one of the largest encountered to date by the FBI in Alaska.“Large scale consumers of child sexual abuse materials like Mr. Brooks directly contribute to the exploitation of children worldwide,” said U.S. Attorney S. Lane Tucker, District of Alaska. “The sentence imposed by the court reflects the seriousness of this type of abhorrent behavior and we will continue to prosecute these cases to the fullest extent of the law. Thanks to the hard work of the FBI and APD, in coordination with our State partners, Mr. Brooks has been brought to justice.”“Our investigation revealed Mr. Brooks acquired and possessed one of the largest collections of child sexual abuse materials found in Alaska,” said Special Agent in Charge Antony Jung of the FBI Anchorage Field Office. “Possession of this material is not a victimless crime, and the FBI will use every legal authority we have to root out predators to protect children from these unconscionable offenses.”The United States Attorney’s Office thanks the State of Alaska. The FBI Anchorage Field Office and the Anchorage Police Department investigated this case as part of the FBI’s Crimes Against Children and Human Trafficking Task Force.This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice. Led by U.S. Attorney’s Offices nationwide and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals who exploit children via the Internet, as well as to identify and rescue victims.

O’Shea, United States Attorney for the Western District of Wisconsin, announced that Mario Johnson, 38, Madison, Wisconsin, was sentenced today by U.S. District Judge William M. Conley to 60 months in federal prison for distributing 50 grams or more of methamphetamine.  Johnson pleaded guilty to this charge on September 14, 2022.From May 2021 to August 2021, law enforcement agents conducted four controlled buys of methamphetamine from Johnson.  The combined amount of methamphetamine from these controlled buys totaled over one pound. During the sentencing hearing, Judge Conley stated that Johnson had become involved in “serious drug dealing” for financial reasons and took note of Johnson’s prior criminal history, which included domestic abuse offenses.  Ultimately, Judge Conley imposed a 60-month prison term followed by a four-year term of supervised release.  He urged Johnson to use his time in prison to seek programming for his mental health, substance abuse, and anger management issues.The charge against Johnson was the result of an investigation conducted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, Dane County Narcotics Task Force, Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigation, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Sun Prairie Police Department.  The investigation was conducted and funded by the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force (OCDETF), a multi-agency task force that coordinates long-term narcotics trafficking investigations.  Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron Wegner and Anita Marie Boor prosecuted this case.</span>

The defendant also admitted to possessing a firearm in furtherance of drug trafficking, a crime that carries a mandatory sentence of five years in prison consecutive to any other penalty. According to court documents, from at least May 2021 until December 2021, Jefferson obtained bulk amounts of cocaine, fentanyl and methamphetamine for resale and distribution in the greater Dayton area. Jefferson and others would travel out-of-state to receive the bulk amounts of narcotics, driving the drugs back to Southern Ohio and staying in hotels along the way. Jefferson’s plea details that he conspired to possess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine, 500 grams or more of methamphetamine and 40 grams or more of fentanyl.          Jefferson kept firearms to protect the illegal drugs and the subsequent drug proceeds. As part of his conviction, Jefferson will forfeit three firearms, multiple rounds of ammunition, a Chevy El Camino and more than $55,000 in cash. Congress sets the mandatory and maximum statutory sentences. Sentencing of the defendant will be determined by the Court based on the advisory sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors at a hearing at a later date. Kenneth L.

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 4 One defendant pleaded guilty on March 27 in an international fraud scheme that preyed on elderly Americans, and the lead defendant in the case was extradited from Spain yesterday in connection with the same scheme.Ezennia Peter Neboh, 48, of Madrid, Spain, made his initial appearance in Miami today to face federal charges. Neboh, and his co-defendants, Kennedy Ikponmwosa, 51, and Prince Amos Okey Ezemma, 49, also of Madrid; and Iheanyichukwu Jonathan Abraham, 44, Emmanuel Samuel, 39, and Jerry Chucks Ozor, 43, of London, were previously charged in the Southern District of Florida with conspiracy to commit mail fraud as well as counts of mail fraud and wire fraud. Samuel pleaded guilty March 27 in Miami to conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud.According to court documents, the defendants allegedly operated an inheritance fraud scheme. As part of that scheme, they sent personalized letters to elderly consumers in the United States over the course of more than five years. The letters falsely claimed that the sender was a representative of a bank in Spain and that the recipient was entitled to receive a multimillion-dollar inheritance left for the recipient by a family member who purportedly had died years before in Spain. According to the indictment, the defendants told a series of lies to consumers including that, before they could receive their purported inheritance, they were required to send money for delivery fees, taxes, and payments to avoid questioning from government authorities. The defendants collected money sent in response to the fraudulent letters through a complex web of U.S.-based former victims, whom the defendants convinced to receive money and forward to the defendants or persons associated with them. According to the indictment, victims who sent money never received any purported inheritance funds.  “Schemes that prey on the elderly are particularly insidious,” said Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “The Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch will pursue and prosecute transnational criminals who defraud U.S. consumers, wherever they are located. I thank the Kingdom of Spain, including the Spanish National Police and the Ministry of Justice, for their tireless efforts in assisting U.S. authorities to find and arrest these individuals so that they may face charges here in the United States.”“The U.S. Postal Inspection Service has a long tradition of protecting citizens from these types of schemes and bringing those responsible to justice,” said Postal Inspector in Charge Juan A. Vargas for the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) Miami Division. “This extradition and guilty plea are a testament of the dedicated partnership between the Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, to protect our citizens from these scams.”“We are one step closer to ensuring that those who conned elderly victims for pure financial greed are brought to justice,” said Special Agent in Charge Scott Brown of HSI Arizona. “The recent extradition of one defendant and the guilty plea of another defendant involved in this inheritance fraud scheme demonstrates the commitment of HSI and our law enforcement partners to target offenders wherever they may live and ensure that those offenders answer for their crimes.”According to court documents, Samuel admitted to defrauding over $6 million from more than 400 victims, many of whom he knew were elderly or otherwise vulnerable.  He is scheduled to be sentenced by the Honorable Kathleen M. Williams on June 13, 2023, and faces a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. The Consumer Protection Branch, USPIS, and HSI are investigating the case. Senior Trial Attorney Phil Toomajian and Trial Attorneys Josh Rothman and Brianna Gardner of the Justice Department’s Consumer Protection Branch are prosecuting the case. The Justice Department's Office of International Affairs, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, Europol, the Spanish National Police, the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency, and the Portuguese Judicial Police all provided critical assistance.The Department urges individuals to be on the lookout for these types of schemes. An inheritance scam is a form of an imposter scam in which fraudsters pretend to be someone they are not, often a lawyer, banker, or foreign official. These fraudsters will try to get people excited about a large windfall and may use legitimate-looking legal documents as part of the scam. Be wary of unexpected contact from individuals offering a large inheritance. Do not send money or provide information to anyone you do not know. Seek advice from a trusted individual or an independent professional if you are in doubt.If you or someone you know is age 60 or older and has experienced financial fraud, experienced professionals are standing by at the National Elder Fraud Hotline: 1-833-FRAUD-11 (1-833-372-8311). This U.S. Department of Justice hotline, managed by the Office for Victims of Crime, can provide personalized support to callers by assessing the needs of the victim and identifying relevant next steps. Case managers will identify appropriate reporting agencies, provide information to callers to assist them in reporting, connect callers directly with appropriate agencies, and provide resources and referrals, on a case-by-case basis. Reporting is the first step. Reporting can help authorities identify those who commit fraud and reporting certain financial losses due to fraud as soon as possible can increase the likelihood of recovering losses. The hotline is open Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. ET. English, Spanish and other languages are available.More information about the Department’s efforts to help American seniors is available at its Elder Justice Initiative webpage.

Cunha.Court documents allege that Ernest P. Ricci and his wife, Brenda L. Ricci, have been accruing large, outstanding debts to creditors and to the IRS dating back to 2004, and that they have engaged in conduct designed to evade their creditors since 2011. It is alleged that, in October 2017, Ernest Ricci filed a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Petition to protect a $1.5 million dollar home in Florida that he and his wife used as both rental property and a vacation home. Bank records indicate that Ricci has failed to make any mortgage payments on the property since at least 2012.Ricci and his wife are alleged to have concealed assets and knowingly made false representations and omissions in filings with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court.  Specifically, according to court documents,  Ricci swore under oath that he had been unemployed for many years; that he had no income, no bank accounts, and no assets or properties other than the Florida home; and that he garnered no compensation of any kind from his wife’s company. In those bankruptcy filings, Ricci at first claimed liabilities in excess of $200,000,000 against assets of $1.3 million. He later amended his filings to claim liabilities of more than $2.3 million.In reality, however, it is alleged that Ricci, before filing for bankruptcy, Ricci transferred all the assets of his business: Premier Home Restoration LLC (Premier) in order to shield those assets from his creditors. While Ricci claimed in bankruptcy filings that, following the transfer of the company’s assets, he performed services for Premier without compensation, according to court documents, an investigation determined that, in fact, Ricci continued to control Premier, ran its day-to-day operations, and made use of company financial resources to maintain his lifestyle.  Among other falsehoods, it is alleged that Ricci failed to truthfully disclose his monthly income; rental income from his Florida property and income from property he owned in New Hampshire; failed to disclose an actual Rolex watch as an asset (he allegedly went so far as to produce a fake watch for the Bankruptcy Trustee to examine); and failed to disclose ownership of a boat he was offering for sale as late as February 2023. Additionally, Ernest and Brenda Ricci allegedly falsely claimed, under oath, that Ernest Ricci held a $200,000 mortgage in the name of another person for the New Hampshire property that, in fact, he owned and for which he was collecting rent.It is further alleged that, after the Bankruptcy Trustee was declared to be the equitable owner of Premier, Ernest and Brenda Ricci fraudulently applied for COVID-related Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) from the Small Business Administration, supposedly to pay Premier employees and to company expenses. When filing, they failed to disclose that the Trustee was the owner of Premier, and that they were involved in bankruptcy proceedings.It is alleged that, after fraudulently obtaining the EDIL and PPP funds, Ernest and Brenda Ricci committed money laundering by conducting a series of financial transactions designed to conceal the location, ownership, and control of the PPP and EDIL proceeds, and to use those funds to purchase rental property in Warwick, RI, in the name of another person.Additionally, it is alleged that Ernest Ricci fraudulently applied for and received COVID-related unemployment benefits from the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training at the same time he collected approximately $84,370 rental property income from his New Hampshire property.Court documents detail a number of alleged stalling tactics, frivolous pleadings, and fraudulent claims by Ernest Ricci, including claims that he was indigent, during the years’ long bankruptcy proceedings. Documents also detail numerous combative communications allegedly sent by Ernest to the bankruptcy Trustee, some laced with profanities.Ernest and Brenda Ricci were arrested by FBI agents on Friday and charged by way of federal criminal complaints filed by the United States Attorney’s Office. Ernest P. Ricci is charged with Bankruptcy Fraud; Wire Fraud; and Money Laundering; Brenda L. Ricci is charged with Aiding and Abetting Bankruptcy Fraud; Aiding and Abetting Concealment of Assets in Bankruptcy; Aiding and Abetting Wire Fraud; and Aiding and Abetting Money Laundering.The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney John P. McAdams.The matter was investigated by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the United States Bankruptcy Trustee.###</span>

The sentence was announced by Jason R. Coody, United States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida.“Our local, state, and federal law enforcement partners work tirelessly to keep us safe by removing addictive and deadly controlled substances from our communities,” said U.S. Attorney Coody. “This sentence demonstrates our commitment to support their efforts through the investigation and vigorous prosecution of criminals who would bring drugs into North Florida.”In May 2021, local investigators received information regarding a drug trafficker receiving large quantities of cocaine through the mail from Puerto Rico.  The Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Postal Inspection Service worked in concert with the local investigators to further identify the conspirators and establish a historical record of the cocaine-laded parcels being shipped to Gainesville from Puerto Rico. As a result of the combined investigative efforts, Vega was held accountable for trafficking approximately 129 kilograms of cocaine between 2018 and June 2022. Authorities were able to seize a total of 12 kilograms of cocaine and tens of thousands of dollars over the course of the investigation.“Ridding our communities of this poison and ensuring the safety and health of our citizens is one of DEA’s top priorities,” said DEA Miami Field Division Special Agent in Charge Deanne L. Reuter. “The success of this investigation is a direct result of the tireless efforts of these dedicated investigators and highlights our continued commitment to working with our law enforcement partners to protect our Florida communities.” “We will continue to work with our partners to take deadly drugs off our streets,” said Miami Division U.S. Postal Inspection Service, Inspector in Charge Juan Vargas. “Preventing the use of the nation’s mail system for illegal activities or illicit gains is a primary focus of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service.”This case resulted from a joint investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration and the United States Postal Inspection Service. Assistant United States Attorney Christopher M. Elsey prosecuted the case.The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Florida is one of 94 offices that serve as the nation’s principal litigators under the direction of the Attorney General.

Tillis was on duty as a supervisory corrections officer at the  Florida State Prison in Raiford. During his shift, one of the inmates in his custody allegedly feigned injury by lying on the floor of his cell. In response, the defendant filled a bottle from a nearby dispenser that provided water at near-boiling temperatures, then poured the scalding water onto the victim’s chest. Tillis also failed to arrange for medical treatment for the victim, who suffered second degree burns on his chest as a result of this assault.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "It is important that corrections officers realize they may not use their positions of authority to inflict physical harm on inmates as punishment," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King for the Civil Rights Division. "While the vast majority of law enforcement officers carry out their difficult duties in a lawful and professional manner, the Department of Justice will continue to vigorously prosecute those who cross the line and commit this type of unlawful act."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Tillis faces a maximum punishment of ten years in prison and a $250,000 fine. A sentencing date has not yet been scheduled by the court.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  This case was investigated by agents from the FBI’s Jacksonville Division and the Florida Office of the Inspector General. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Mac Heavener of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Florida and Department of Justice Civil Rights Division Trial Attorney Douglas Kern.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The Civil Rights Division is committed to the vigorous enforcement of every federal criminal civil rights statute, such as those laws that prohibit the willful use of excessive force or other acts of misconduct by law enforcement and other government officials. In FY2008, the Criminal Section filed the largest-ever number of federal criminal civil rights cases in a single year in the Section’s history, and the second-highest ever number of official misconduct prosecutions.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney for the District of Puerto Rico Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-Vélez announced.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;De Castro Font pleaded guilty to devising and engaging in a scheme that deprived the people of Puerto Rico of his honest services as a legislator, performed free from conflict of interest, concealment and improper influence. De Castro Font also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit extortion through fear of economic harm and under color of official right. De Castro Font was indicted for these and other related offenses on Oct. 2, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;De Castro Font entered his guilty plea before U.S. District Judge Francisco Augusto Besosa in the District of Puerto Rico. De Castro Font admitted that from Jan. 2, 2005, through August 2008, he directly and indirectly solicited between approximately $500,000 and $525,000 in cash payments and other benefits, such as campaign contributions in excess of the legal limits, lodging, private flights, meals and other things of value, from individuals. De Castro Font admitted that he engaged in official acts on behalf of some of these individuals who had provided him with these undisclosed benefits, including but not limited to, proposing legislation, preventing legislative projects to be voted or acted upon, and persuading other legislators to vote for or against legislation.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;De Castro Font also admitted to participating in a conspiracy to obtain cash and other benefits from five individuals whom he admitted he knew felt that if they did not provide him with the financial benefits requested, De Castro Font could use his official position to harm their financial interests.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Judge Besosa scheduled a sentencing hearing on Apr. 23, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;"Using an elected office for personal gain denies citizens the honest services of their elected leaders," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin. "The Department will continue to identify and prosecute public officials who corruptly use their position and influence to illegally benefit themselves."&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;"Senator De Castro Font has accepted responsibility for the acts of public corruption charged in the indictment. His conduct was an affront to the voters of Puerto Rico who placed their trust and confidence in him and the institution that he represented, the Senate of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. His blatant disregard for his oath of office and his breach of the public trust, for his personal enrichment, violated the very essence of our democratic government. We will continue our public corruption investigations against public officials and those who make illegal payments in exchange for official acts," said U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;"Let this conviction send a stark message to all public servants that the sale of influence and public corruption will not be tolerated by the FBI or the law-abiding citizens of Puerto Rico," said Luis Fraticelli, Special Agent in Charge of the FBI-San Juan Field Office.  "The FBI will continue to be vigilant so as to root out all public corruption.  As I have said before, corruption affects every facet of society: the people, honest businessmen, education and public works."&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On Dec. 4, 2008, Alberto Goachet, a political consultant and aide to De Castro Font, pleaded guilty to participating in the conspiracy to launder illegal campaign contributions and other payments.  Goachet admitted that he and others laundered the money through the use of fake invoices purporting to reflect legitimate payments to a political consulting firm owned by Goachet. Goachet admitted that the false invoices were meant to conceal a businessman’s illegal payments to De Castro Font. Goachet also admitted that in August 2008 he falsely claimed in an interview with the FBI that the invoices were legitimately written for services rendered to the businessman and denied that the money was intended for De Castro Font.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Jacqueline Novas and Timothy R. Henwood of the District of Puerto Rico, and Trial Attorney Matthew L. Stennes of the Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section. The case was investigated by the FBI’s San Juan Field Office.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Factual Basis&lt;/p&gt;\n</span>

Breuer de la División de lo Penal; el Fiscal Federal Wifredo A. Ferrer del Distrito Sur de Florida; y Daniel W. Auer, Agente Especial a Cargo del Servicio de Impuestos Internos, Oficina Local de Miami de Investigaciones Penales (IRS-CI).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Antonio Perez, 52, de Miami, también fue condenado por el Juez Federal de Distrito Jose E. Martinez a dos años de libertad bajo supervisión después de haber cumplido su sentencia en prisión, y a entregar $36,375 al gobierno. Perez se declaró culpable el 27 de abril de 2009, de conspirar para realizar pagos corruptos para una compañía de telecomunicaciones del Condado de Miami-Dade a funcionarios de la compañía de telecomunicaciones estatal de la República de Haití, Telecommunications D'Haiti, en violación de la Ley de Prácticas Corruptas en el Extranjero (FCPA) y leyes de lavado de dinero.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;En su declaración de culpabilidad, Perez admitió haber conspirado para realizar pagos corruptos a funcionarios gubernamentales extranjeros con la finalidad de obtener ventajas comerciales para la empresa de telecomunicaciones por parte de Telecommunications D'Haiti. De acuerdo con el expediente judicial, Perez conspiró con Robert Antoine, el ex director de relaciones internacionales para Telecommunications D'Haiti y Juan Diaz, el propietario de J.D. Locator Services, junto con otros. Perez y sus coconspiradores ocultaros los pagos de sobornos en parte al conducir transacciones financieras en las que se realizaron transferencias telegráficas de dinero a empresas fantasma y a través de denominaciones falsas en facturas, cheques y libros contables. Perez admitió que él mismo estuvo involucrado en dos pagos de sobornos por un total de aproximadamente 36,375 dólares.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;El 30 de julio de 2010, Diaz fue sentenciado a 57 meses en prisión después de haberse declarado culpable de pagar y ocultar 1,028,851 dólares en sobornos a ex funcionarios del gobierno de Haití mientras actuaba como intermediario para tres empresas privadas de telecomunicaciones. Antoine admitió que aceptó los sobornos, incluidos sobornos de Diaz, y se declaró culpable el 12 de marzo de 2010 a conspiración para cometer lavado de dinero. Antoine fue sentenciado a cuatro años en prisión.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Joel Esquenazi y Carlos Rodriguez, los propietarios de la empresa de telecomunicaciones en la que trabajaba Perez, así como Jean Rene Duperval, quien fue director de relaciones internacionales de Telecommunications D´'Haiti de junio de 2003 a abril de 2004, y la hermana de Duperval, Marguerite Grandison, fueron acusados formalmente junto con Antoine, el 4 de diciembre de 2009. El enjuiciamiento de los demás demandados tiene su inicio programado para el 28 de febrero de 2011 en el Tribunal Federal de Distrito en Miami. Una acusación formal es apenas una acusación, y se supone que los demandados son inocentes hasta que se pruebe lo contrario más allá de la duda razonable.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;El Departamento de Justicia agradece al gobierno de Haití por su importante asistencia en recabar pruebas durante esta investigación. En particular, la unidad de inteligencia financiera de Haiti, la Unite Centrale de Renseignements Financiers, el Bureau des Affaires Financieres et Economiques, el cual es un componente especializado de la Policía Nacional Haitiana, y el Ministerio de Justicia y Seguridad Pública brindar importante cooperación y coordinación en la investigación.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Están a cargo de la acusación en el caso la Fiscal Federal Auxiliar Aurora Fagan de la Fiscalía Federal para el Distrito Sur de Florida, la Abogada Litigante Sénior Nicola J. Mrazek de la Sección de Fraude de la División de lo Penal y el Abogado Litigante Kevin Gerrity de la Sección de Confiscación de Activos y Lavado de Dinero de la División de lo Penal.

(LAN Cargo), Aerolinhas Brasileiras S.A. (ABSA), and EL AL Israel Airlines Ltd. (EL AL), have each agreed to plead guilty and pay criminal fines totaling $124.7 million for their roles in a conspiracy to fix prices in the air cargo industry, the Department of Justice announced today. Under the plea agreements, LAN Cargo, a Chilean company, and ABSA, a Brazilian company that is substantially owned by LAN Cargo, have agreed to pay a single criminal fine of $109 million. EL AL, an Israeli company, has agreed to pay a criminal fine of $15.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Including today’s charges, a total of 12 airlines and three executives have pleaded guilty or agreed to plead guilty in the Justice Department’s ongoing investigation into price fixing in the air transportation industry. To date, more than $1 billion in criminal fines have been imposed and executives have been sentenced to serve a total of 20 months in jail.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to the charges filed today in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, each airline engaged in a conspiracy in the United States and elsewhere to eliminate competition by fixing the cargo rates charged to customers for international air shipments, including to and from the United States. LAN Cargo and ABSA are charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about February 2003 and continuing until at least Feb. 14, 2006. EL AL is charged with engaging in the conspiracy from in or about January 2003 until at least Feb. 14, 2006. The plea agreements are subject to court approval. Each airline has agreed to cooperate with the Department’s ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "American consumers were forced to pay higher prices on the goods they buy every day as a result of the inflated and collusive shipping rates charged by these companies," said Scott D. Hammond, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Department’s Antitrust Division.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  LAN Cargo, ABSA and EL AL are charged with carrying out the price-fixing conspiracy with co-conspirators by:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participating in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere to discuss the cargo rates to be charged on certain routes to and from the United States;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Agreeing, during those meetings, conversations and communications on certain components of the cargo rates to charge for shipments on certain routes to and from the United States; &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Levying cargo rates in the United States and elsewhere in accordance with the agreements reached; and&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Engaging in meetings, conversations and communications in the United States and elsewhere for the purpose of monitoring and enforcing adherence to the agreed-upon cargo rates.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The nine airlines that have pleaded guilty to date as a result of the Department’s ongoing investigation into the air transportation industry are: British Airways Plc (British Airways), Korean Air Lines Ltd., Qantas Airways Limited (Qantas), Japan Airlines International Co. Ltd., Martinair Holland N.V., Cathay Pacific Airways Limited, SAS Cargo Group A/S (SAS), Société Air France and Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij N.V. (KLM Royal Dutch Airlines). The three airline executives who have pleaded guilty for their involvement in the illegal activity are Bruce McCaffrey of Qantas, Timothy Pfeil of SAS and Keith Packer of British Airways.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  EL AL, LAN Cargo and ABSA are charged with price fixing in violation of the Sherman Act, a violation which carries a maximum sentence of $100 million for corporations. The maximum fine may be increased to twice the gain derived from the crime or twice the loss suffered by the victims of the crime, if either of those amounts is greater than the statutory maximum fine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The ongoing investigation is being conducted by the Antitrust Division’s National Criminal Enforcement Section and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Anyone with information concerning price fixing or other anticompetitive conduct in the air transportation industry is urged to call the National Criminal Enforcement Section of the Antitrust Division at 202-307-6694 or the FBI Washington Field Office, Northern Virginia Resident Agency at 703- 686-6000.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Grant, Special Agent-in-Charge of the FBI’s Chicago Field Office announced.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  William Cozzi, 51, pleaded guilty to a one-count information in U.S. District Court in Chicago, admitting he used excessive or unreasonable force while acting under color of law. Cozzi joined the Chicago Police Department in 1992 and was assigned to the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; District at the time of the alleged incident. He was subsequently suspended from duty. Cozzi was indicted in April 2008 for depriving the victim of his civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  On Aug. 2, 2005, while performing his duties as a police officer, Cozzi admitted that he used a "sap," a dangerous weapon similar to a blackjack, to repeatedly strike the victim who was handcuffed and shackled in a wheelchair at Norwegian American Hospital, resulting in bodily injury. At the time, the victim was awaiting treatment in the hospital emergency room after being stabbed in the shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The defendant violated the public trust by abusing his law enforcement authority," said Acting Assistant Attorney General Loretta King.  "This prosecution demonstrates that the Civil Rights Division is committed to aggressively prosecuting law enforcement officers who willfully use excessive force."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "No law enforcement officer may use unreasonable force with impunity and every citizen, regardless of being in police custody, has a constitutional right to be free from the use of excessive force," U.S. Attorney Fitzgerald said.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Cozzi pleaded guilty while reserving his right to appeal a ruling last year denying his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the prosecution was based in part on compelled statements he made to the Chicago Police Department’s Office of Professional Standards and during a police review board hearing.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to a plea agreement, Cozzi was dispatched to the hospital to respond to the stabbing and approached the victim who was being loud and verbally abusive while awaiting treatment for the stabbing. Shortly after approaching the victim, Cozzi placed him in handcuffs and left the emergency room to retrieve leg shackles, which he then placed on the victim. With the victim restrained, Cozzi used a sap to repeatedly strike him in the face and body. According to the plea agreement, at the time of the assault the victim posed no physical threat to Cozzi or anyone else at the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Cozzi also admitted that he subsequently prepared a false arrest report and misdemeanor complaints stating that the victim attempted to punch him and two hospital security guards, as well as a false tactical response report stating that he used an "open hand strike" on the victim but omitted that he struck the victim with a sap.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning set sentencing for March 26, 2009. Cozzi faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Scott Drury from the U. S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois and Trial Attorney Betsy Biffl of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 6   &lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON – Phat Ngoc Tran, 35, pleaded guilty today in San Diego to conspiring to participate in a racketeering enterprise, the "Tran Organization," in a scheme to cheat at least 12 casinos across the United States and Canada out of millions of dollars, Acting Assistant Attorney General Rita M. Glavin of the Criminal Division and U.S. Attorney Karen P. Hewitt for the Southern District of California announced today. Tran admitted that he and his co-conspirators unlawfully obtained up to $2.5 million during card cheats.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  A three-count indictment was returned May 22, 2007, and unsealed in the Southern District of California on May 24, 2007, charging Tran and 13 others each with one count of conspiracy to participate in the affairs of a racketeering enterprise; one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering. The indictment also charged five separate individuals each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos; and one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  In his plea agreement, Tran admitted that on numerous occasions between approximately October 2002 and July 2006, he participated in gambling cheats together with other alleged members of the Tran Organization at casinos in the United States and Canada. Tran admitted to targeting at least 12 casinos in the racketeering conspiracy, including:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Beau Rivage Casino, in Biloxi, Miss.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Casino Rama, in Orillia, Ontario, Canada;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, Conn.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Gold Strike Casino in Tunica, Miss.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Horseshoe Casino, in Bossier City, La.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Horseshoe Casino and Hotel, in Tunica, Miss.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Isle of Capri Casino, in Westlake, La.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Majestic Star Casino, in Gary, Ind.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Mohegan Sun Resort Casino, in Uncasville, Conn.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Palace Station Casino, in Las Vegas, Nev.;&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Resorts East Chicago Hotel and Casino, in East Chicago, Ind.; and &lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Sycuan Casino, in El Cajon, Calif.&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;  According to the indictment, the defendants and others executed a "false shuffle" cheating scheme at casinos in the United States and Canada during blackjack and mini-baccarat games. The indictment alleges that members of the criminal organization bribed casino card dealers and supervisors to perform false shuffles during card games, thereby creating "slugs" or groups, of un-shuffled cards. The indictment also alleges that after tracking the order of cards dealt in a card game, a member of the organization would signal to the card dealer to perform a "false shuffle," and members of the group would then bet on the known order of cards when the slug appeared on the table. By doing so, members of the conspiracy repeatedly won thousands of dollars during card games, including winning up to $868,000 on one occasion.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The indictment also alleges that the members of the organization used sophisticated mechanisms for tracking the order of cards during games, including hidden transmitter devices and specially created software that would predict the order in which cards would reappear during mini-baccarat and blackjack games.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  An indictment is merely an allegation and is not evidence of guilt. A defendant is entitled to a fair trial in which it will be the government’s burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Tran’s sentencing is scheduled for June 1, 2009, in San Diego before U.S. District Judge John A. Houston. At sentencing, Tran faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison on the racketeering conspiracy charge. Tran agreed to a personal money judgment in the amount of $180,000, which will be entered by way of a preliminary order of forfeiture. He also acknowledged that the restitution that he may be ordered to pay by the court at sentencing is not limited by the forfeiture amount. Tran was also charged in Orillia, Ontario, Canada, for his admitted cheating activities at Casino Rama.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  A second indictment has alleged that 11 additional defendants conspired to commit offenses on behalf of the Tran Organization. A one-count indictment, unsealed in the Southern District of California on Sept. 11, 2008, charged Bryan Arce; Don Man Duong; Hogan Ho; Thang Viet Huynh; Outtama Keovongsa; Leap Kong, a/k/a Lanida Kong; Qua Le; Khunsela Prom, a/k/a Danny Prom; James Root; Darrell Saicocie; and Dan Thich each with one count of conspiracy to commit several offenses against the United States, including conspiracy to steal money and other property from Indian tribal casinos, and conspiracy to travel in interstate and foreign commerce in aid of racketeering.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  To date, 20 defendants, including Tran, have pleaded guilty to charges relating to the casino-cheating conspiracy: Phuong Quoc Truong; Anh Phuong Tran; Martin Lee Aronson; Liem Thanh Lam; George Michael Lee; Tien Duc Vu; Son Hong Johnson; Barry Wellford; Willy Tran; Tuan Mong Le; Duc Cong Nguyen; Han Truong Nguyen; Roderick Vang Thor; Sisouvanh Mounlasy; Navin Nith; Renee Cuc Quang; Ui Suk Weller; Phally Ly; and Khunsela Prom. These defendants admitted to targeting, with the aid of coconspirators, a combined total of approximately 24 casinos during the course of the conspiracy.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The case is being investigated by the FBI’s San Diego Field Office; the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation; the San Diego Sheriff’s Department; and the California Department of Justice’s Bureau of Gambling Control. The investigation has received assistance from federal, state, tribal and foreign authorities, including: the Ontario Provincial Police; the National Indian Gaming Commission; the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Washington; FBI Resident Agencies in Gulfport, Miss., Tacoma, Wash., and Toledo, Ohio; the Indiana State Police; the Rumsey Rancheria Tribal Gaming Agency; the Sycuan Gaming Commission; the Barona Gaming Commission; the Mississippi Gaming Commission; and the Washington State Gambling Commission.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The prosecution of the case is led by the Criminal Division’s Organized Crime and Racketeering Section (OCRS). Department of Justice Trial Attorneys Joseph K. Wheatley, Robert S. Tully and Gavin A. Corn are prosecuting the indictment in San Diego.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
