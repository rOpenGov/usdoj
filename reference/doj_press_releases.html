Kirkpatrick. He also was ordered to pay restitution to his victims and a $7,500 assessment pursuant to the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Assistance Act of 2018.&amp;nbsp;“Few crimes are as heinous as the sexual exploitation of minors,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Kirkpatrick. “My office will continue to prioritize charging predators who hold positions of trust in our community. &amp;nbsp;Coaches, daycare providers, and others in positions of trust who prey on children will face federal justice.” &amp;nbsp;“The sentencing of Lucas Mathew Kramer concludes a successful investigation focused on those who seek to exploit our children. HSI will continue to pursue and bring to justice those who target our young people,” said ICE HSI Saint Paul Special Agent in Charge Jamie Holt. “We appreciate the collaboration with our law enforcement partners and stand by our commitment to protecting our communities and securing our homeland.”According to court documents, on September 23, 2022, law enforcement received a tip that an online individual with the username “northernboy35” had used the Kik messenger application to upload 19 videos of child pornography to the internet. Less than a week later, the same username uploaded five additional child pornography videos to the internet. Law enforcement quickly determined that the uploaded files originated from Duluth, Minnesota, and linked the email and IP address for the “nothernboy35” moniker directly to Lucas Mathew Kramer, 45, a longtime collegiate climbing coach.&amp;nbsp;Law enforcement proceeded to execute a search warrant at Kramer’s residence and discovered that he had knowingly possessed over 600 images and videos of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) on numerous electronic devices. His CSAM collection included the graphic sexual abuse of prepubescent children—some as young as toddlers—and included videos depicting children being physically forced into sexual compliance. Kramer admitted that he downloaded and traded his CSAM collection with others on the internet. Law enforcement also discovered evidence of sexually explicit chats between Kramer and self-identified prepubescent minors, where he engaged the self-identified minors in sexually explicit conversations and encouraged them to take and send nude images of themselves. &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Kramer pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography on October 11, 2024. He was sentenced in U.S. District Court by Judge Eric C. Tostrud on March 19, 2024. When handing down the sentence, Judge Tostrud remarked that Kramer’s conduct was “deeply troubling” and that his collection of CSAM materials “reflected depravity” and showed a “callous indifference” to the humanity of his victims.This case is the result of an investigation conducted by Homeland Security Investigations and the Duluth Police Department. “The Duluth Police Department appreciates its partnership with Homeland Security Investigations in holding this offender accountable to the highest standards,” commented Duluth Police Chief Mike Ceynowa.The case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.

Ramsdell announced today that&amp;nbsp;U.S. District Judge Camela C. Theeler has sentenced an Oglala, South Dakota, man following his conviction for two counts of Receipt of Child Pornography.&amp;nbsp;The sentencing took place on March 17, 2025.Johnathan Morrison, 34, was sentenced to eight years and nine months in federal prison on each count for a total of 210 months in prison, followed by five years of supervised release on each count with the time to run concurrently, and ordered to pay a $100 special assessment to the Federal Crime Victims Fund for each count. Morrison was also ordered to pay $95 in restitution to the South Dakota Internet Crimes Investigation Fund and to forfeit his interest in a smartphone. He will also be required to register as a sex offender under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.A federal grand jury indicted Morrison in February of 2024. He pleaded guilty on January 8, 2025.In August 2023, Morrison solicited a 10-year old female to engage in sexually explicit conduct over social media. Shortly thereafter, an adult learned that Morrison had enticed the child and reported Morrison’s criminal actions to the Oglala Sioux Tribe Department of Public Safety. Morrison was immediately apprehended and arrested. His smartphone was seized as evidence. An extraction of his smartphone revealed that prior to August 2023, Morrison downloaded and installed multiple social media platforms, including KIK, Telegram, and Snapchat onto his cellular device. Through these platforms, Morrison solicited, sent, and received images and videos containing child pornography. Some of the images recovered involved prepubescent females engaged in sexual acts. Through his chats, investigators learned that Morrison had an interest in 10-14 year old females. The search also revealed that Morrison had made sexual advances to his girlfriend’s teenage daughter and that he had covertly photographed her over 130 times with his smartphone.This case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse, launched in May 2006 by the Department of Justice.

She was also ordered to pay over&amp;nbsp;$20 million in restitution to the IRS.Beatriz Toledo, 61, owned&amp;nbsp;Immigration and Tax Service Group LLC. For tax years 2017 through 2021, Toledo,&amp;nbsp;through her company, willfully prepared false and fraudulent tax returns for clients, which included false claims for the Residential Energy Credit (allowing taxpayers to claim a credit for qualified energy-saving expenses), false itemized deductions for state and local sales taxes, and false business expenses. Through these false claims, Toledo’s clients’ taxable income decreased, leading to bigger tax refunds.During the scheme, Toledo submitted about 7,800 tax returns with fraudulent claims for residential energy tax credits, resulting in her clients’ underpayment of about $20 million in federal taxes. Toledo’s company received approximately $7.1 million in tax preparation fees that it took directly out of clients’ refund checks.Toledo engaged in this criminal conduct in violation of a permanent injunction previously entered against her by a federal district judge in 2010. Case No. 09-cv-21987-COOKE. In that civil case, the United States sued to bar Toledo from preparing false tax returns. Toledo agreed to a permanent injunction, which the district court entered on July 26, 2020. The injunction prohibited her from engaging in the conduct described above. Despite the injunction’s prohibitions, Toledo continued to prepare false tax returns and was indicted in 2024.&amp;nbsp;U.S. Attorney Hayden P.

Tenpas, Assistant Attorney General for the Environment and Natural Resources Division of the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;“This settlement will result in cleaner air for California,” said Deborah Jordan, director of the EPA’s Air Division in the Pacific Southwest region.&amp;nbsp; “This facility is the largest source of nitrogen oxide—an air pollutant that causes smog—in California, so the state-of-the-art air pollution controls that CEMEX is installing will have a significant impact on air quality.”&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The settlement resolves the EPA’s claims that on two separate occasions, in 1997 and 2000, CEMEX violated the Clean Air Act by undertaking major plant modifications resulting in significant increases in the Victorville plant’s capacity to pollute without first undergoing required regulatory review or obtaining required permits under the Clean Air Act’s Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, program and without installing state-of-the-art emission controls that would reduce contaminants such as nitrogen oxide.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nitrogen oxide is a harmful air pollutant that causes smog and leads to respiratory problems in children and the elderly.&amp;nbsp; The Victorville area fails to meet federal air quality standards for both ozone and particulate matter.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The proposed consent decree is subject to a 30-day public comment period and final court approval.&amp;nbsp; A copy of the consent decree is available on the Department of Justice Web site at &lt;a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html"&gt;http://www.usdoj.gov/enrd/Consent_Decrees.html&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; For more information on the settlement and the Clean Air Act, please visit: &lt;a href="http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/index.html"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/region09/air/index.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n</span>

The Court of Review upheld the lawfulness of the directives, concluding that the surveillance at issue fell within the foreign intelligence exception to the warrant requirement and was otherwise reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The Court issued a classified version of its opinion in August 2008 and subsequently requested publication of an unclassified version.

The agreement follows the Department’s investigation of the facility, which found substantial civil rights violations.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "I appreciate King County’s cooperation during our investigation and commend the leadership of the King County Executive and the County Council for their commitment to improve conditions at the jail," said Grace Chung Becker, Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division. "Today’s agreement will ensure that necessary measures are taken so that the County will meet its obligations under the law."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The Department’s investigation identified inadequate medical care and contagious disease prevention and treatment services, inadequate security and detention practices, and inadequate suicide prevention procedures. The agreement requires the implementation of measures to ensure that the identified deficiencies are remedied and that the services and systems to address the inadequate conditions are consistent with constitutional standards.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The Civil Rights Division conducted its investigation pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, which authorizes the federal government to identify and root out systemic abuses. The Civil Rights Division has successfully resolved similar investigations of other adult correctional facilities in numerous other jurisdictions, including Arkansas, Delaware, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The Department of Justice’s enforcement effort reaches beyond adult correctional facilities. Since 2001, the Department of Justice has opened 97 similar investigations into conditions of confinement at correctional facilities, juvenile detention centers, nursing homes, mental health facilities and residences for persons with developmental disabilities throughout the United States.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  More information about the Special Litigation Section of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division can be found at &lt;a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/index.html"&gt;  &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;    &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;"&gt;  http://www.usdoj.gov/crt/split/index.html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

Alexander Acosta of the Southern District of Florida announced today.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Juan A. "Tony" Marrero, 41, Belkis Marrero, 41, and Luz Borrego, 43, each pleaded guilty on Jan. 14, 2009, to conspiracy to commit healthcare fraud before U.S. District Judge Ursula Ungaro in the Southern District of Florida. In their pleas, Tony and Belkis Marrero admitted that they co-owned two Miami clinics named Medcore Group LLC (Medcore) and M&amp;amp;P Group of South Florida Inc. (M&amp;amp;P).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Medcore and M&amp;amp;P purported to specialize in the treatment of HIV-positive patients. The Marreros admitted that beginning in August 2004 and continuing through November 2006 they conspired with others to submit approximately $5.3 million in fraudulent claims to Medicare. Borrego acknowledged her role in the fraud at Medcore where she was a phlebotomist who administered unnecessary drugs intravenously to HIV patients. Tony Marrero also pleaded guilty to two separate conspiracies to launder the proceeds of the health care fraud. Sentencing for all three defendants is scheduled for April 3, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  During their pleas, the defendants admitted that Medcore and M&amp;amp;P were operated for the purpose of defrauding Medicare and that the treatments for infused or injected drugs billed to Medicare were not medically necessary. Each of the defendants also admitted that all of the patients at the clinics were participants in the fraud. The defendants admitted that they, or their co-conspirators, entered into kickback arrangements with these Medicare beneficiaries whereby the beneficiaries were paid every week in exchange for their Medicare billing information, which allowed the clinics to submit the fraudulent bills.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  To obtain all the cash necessary to pay the patients, Tony Marrero admitted that he and others would write checks that appeared legitimate to people who would cash the checks and then return the cash to them for a fee.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The defendants admitted that none of the Medicare beneficiaries needed the injection and infusion treatments billed to Medicare by the clinics. Tony and Belkis Marrero acknowledged that clinic employees intentionally manipulated patients’ blood samples so that they would appear to need treatment, when in fact they did not. Belkis Marrero and Borrego also admitted that they put together medical files to make them appear legitimate and that they supported the treatments being billed to Medicare.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  On Jan. 7, 2009, Orlando Pascual Jr., a co-owner of Medcore and M&amp;amp;P, pleaded guilty to his role in the Medicare fraud and money laundering conspiracies. Pascual is currently incarcerated for Medicare fraud involving the operation of a separate durable medical equipment company that he operated from 2001 to 2003.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  On Jan. 14, 2009, Harold Sio, the owner of pharmaceutical wholesale company named Lifecare Medical, was charged by criminal information with conspiracy to commit health care fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Sio, whose company supplied Medcore and M&amp;amp;P with infusible drugs, allegedly conspired with Pascual and Tony Marrero to accomplish the health care fraud scheme by providing false invoices for the drugs allegedly used in the scheme.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Four co-defendants in the case are scheduled for trial beginning Feb. 9, 2009, in the Southern District of Florida. An indictment and an information are merely charges, and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The case was prosecuted by Deputy Chief Kirk Ogrosky, Assistant Chief John S. (Jay) Darden, and Trial Attorney Charles Reed of the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section, and was investigated by the Department of Health and Human Services, Office of the Inspector General and the FBI. The case was brought as part of the Medicare Fraud Strike Force (MFSF), supervised by the Criminal Division’s Fraud Section and U.S. Attorney Acosta of the Southern District of Florida. Since the inception of MFSF operations, federal prosecutors have indicted 106 cases with 190 defendants in both Los Angeles and Miami. Collectively, these defendants fraudulently billed the Medicare program for more than half a billion dollars.&lt;/p&gt;</span>

McCann, who operates a firm called SWMc Services in the Houma, La., area, to stop claiming improper tax deductions on federal income tax returns he prepares for customers, the Justice Department announced today. McCann agreed to the civil injunction order.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to the &lt;a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/txdv081077.htm"&gt;  &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;    &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;"&gt;  government complaint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; filed in the case, McCann prepared nearly 1,000 federal income tax returns claiming fraudulent employee expense deductions for customers who work as mariners. The government alleged that these deductions were false because the expenses McCann claimed for his customers were never paid by the clients. Instead, their employers provided the items being deducted, including meals and other incidental expenses. In 2007, a &lt;a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/txdv07641.htm"&gt;  &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;    &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;"&gt;  federal court in Los Angeles barred another CPA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Martin A. Kapp, from promoting a similar scheme.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "The IRS and Justice Department are committed to stopping tax preparers who continue to promote the mariner’s tax deduction, which courts have held is frivolous," said Nathan J. Hochman, Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department’s Tax Division. "The Justice Department has obtained injunctions against more than 365 tax return preparers and tax-fraud promoters since 2001." Information about those cases is available &lt;a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/tax/taxpress2009.htm"&gt;  &lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;    &lt;span style="color: #0000ff;"&gt;  on the Justice Department Web site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Assistant Attorney General Hochman thanked trial attorney Grayson Hoffman and IRS revenue agent Phil Rampey for their efforts in obtaining this injunction for the government.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 6   &lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON – Zubair Ahmed, 29, and Khaleel Ahmed, 28, both residents of Chicago, pleaded guilty today in the Northern District of Ohio to conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists in connection with their efforts to travel abroad in order to murder or maim U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Today’s guilty pleas were announced by Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security; William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio; and C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Zubair Ahmed and his cousin Khaleel Ahmed each pleaded guilty before Chief U.S. District Judge James G. Carr in Toledo, Ohio, to a one-count, superseding information charging them with conspiracy to provide material support and resources, including the defendants themselves as personnel, to terrorists in violation of Title 18, U.S.C. Section 2339A. At sentencing, each defendant faces a statutory maximum of 15 years imprisonment and a $250,000 fine, followed by three years of supervised release.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  According to the superseding information and other information entered into the court record today:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  The criminal conspiracy involving Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed began no later than April 1, 2004, and continued until their arrests on Feb. 21, 2007. As part of the conspiracy, the defendants made preparations to travel overseas in order to engage in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in either Iraq or Afghanistan. On or about May 21, 2004, the defendants traveled to Cairo, Egypt, with the intent of engaging in acts that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq or Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  After their return from Egypt, on or about July 4, 2004, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed discussed, sought and received instruction on firearms from another individual in Cleveland. The defendants also sought and discussed training in counter-surveillance techniques and sniper rifles with this individual. Specifically, defendant Zubair Ahmed discussed his desire to learn how to use and move with a .50-caliber machine gun.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  As part of the conspiracy, the defendants also communicated with each other using code words and in a foreign language to disguise their preparations and plans to engage in acts abroad that would result in the murder or maiming of U.S. military forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  Furthermore, Zubair and Khaleel Ahmed researched the purchase of firearms, methods of obtaining firearms instruction (including at least one visit to a firing range) and methods of obtaining instruction in gunsmithing. In addition, the defendants collected and distributed videos of attacks on U.S. military forces overseas, manuals on military tactics and military manuals on weaponry.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  "Today’s guilty pleas should send a strong message to individuals who would use this country as a platform to plot attacks against U.S. military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Matthew Olsen, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for National Security. "This case also underscores the need for continued vigilance in identifying and dismantling extremist plots that develop within our nation."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  William J. Edwards, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, said: "These guilty pleas are testament to the hard work and dedication of all the federal, state and local law enforcement officials who have spent years investigating this case and to the tireless efforts and perseverance of an extremely talented team of federal prosecutors who, with their law enforcement partners, keep this country safe from terrorists."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  C. Frank Figliuzzi, Special Agent in Charge, Cleveland Division, FBI, said: "This case is an example of our continued efforts to detect terrorist planning and to prevent acts of terrorism before they occur.&amp;nbsp; Through close cooperation with our law enforcement partners in Illinois and Ohio, this case resulted in the successful prosecution of these individuals."&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  This case was investigated by the FBI and the Joint Terrorism Task Force in Chicago, Illinois and Toledo, Ohio, with the assistance of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement; U.S. Customs and Border Protection; the Chicago Police Department; the Illinois State Police; the Ohio Highway Patrol; the Toledo Police Department; and the Lucas and Wood County Sheriff’s Departments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;  This case is being prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorneys Thomas E. Getz and Justin E. Herdman of the National Security Unit of the U.S Attorney’s Office in Cleveland; as well Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregg N. Sofer of the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Austin, Texas (formerly of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section); and Trial Attorneys Jerome J. Teresinski and Jolie F. Zimmerman of the Justice Department’s Counterterrorism Section. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Chicago also provided assistance in this case.&lt;/p&gt;</span>
