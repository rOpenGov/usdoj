                                                                                                                               Remarks as DeliveredThank you, Kris, for that introduction and for your leadership, which is so powerful, always. I want to say good afternoon to all of you, to Members of Congress, including Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, and to my DOJ colleagues here and to other esteemed guests.As you all know, human trafficking, be it labor or sex trafficking, feeds on exploitation and often upon members of our communities who are already vulnerable, like unhoused youth, persons without lawful immigration status or those experiencing poverty. Data also suggest that while human trafficking impacts every racial and ethnic group in America, it disproportionately impacts Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American persons, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and other persons of color. Victims of human trafficking often face challenges in accessing trauma-informed and culturally responsive assistance and support and may encounter numerous obstacles when accessing justice or services. Human trafficking, with its complex and interlocking issues, demands the best of us and the best from us.It is imperative that we employ victim-centered, trauma-informed, and culturally responsive approaches to this work. Over the years we’ve learned not just the value of this approach, but frankly, the consequence of its failure. Earning the trust of survivors is an important step in detecting trafficking in the first place. Building rapport and engaging with survivors is instrumental to removing barriers that can otherwise prevent survivors from coming forward, accessing services and from potentially participating as witnesses in successful investigations and prosecutions of human trafficking cases. And finally, continued and collaborative engagement with this process and people with lived experiences is fundamental to a holistic and enduring effort to build capacity to respond to human trafficking. Progress is not guaranteed. It is hard-fought, and it is earned by the hard work we — and especially all of you — put in day after day. You all move us towards progress.The Justice Department’s National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking reflects the department’s whole-of-agency approach to ensuring that victims of human trafficking are properly identified and receive the necessary support and services to heal and ultimately, to thrive.Our FBI Crimes Against Children and Human Trafficking Unit partners with a range of federal, state, local and Tribal authorities to identify and investigate these crimes.Our FBI Victim Services Division makes certain that identified victims understand their rights under the Victims Rights and Restitution Act and Crime Victims’ Rights Act and are provided critical services immediately following identification.Our specialized prosecutors in the Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit and the Criminal Division’s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section work with U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide to strategically and compassionately prosecute these cases.Our Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section helps recover traffickers’ ill-gotten gains and ensure that survivors receive the mandatory restitution they’re entitled to. They also build affirmative cases against traffickers by identifying money flows and related financial investigative steps to identify the traffickers’ financial networks with a particular focus on money laundering charges.Our Office of Justice Programs provide grants, training, technical assistance, research, statistics, and other resources to improve our capacity to respond to human trafficking.And as you just heard from Kris in her welcome remarks, OVC in particular is spearheading our grant making efforts, making it possible for communities to better serve trafficking survivors.Our Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) funds community-based efforts to address the needs of children and youth victims of sex trafficking. OVW also provides funding to support prevention, intervention, and response activities, including culturally specific supportive services for American Indian and Alaska Native victims of sex trafficking. I am so proud of the work and the progress this department has made and of the transformations in the anti-trafficking field, including many spearheaded by the Office for Victims of Crime.Over the past two decades, the funding and resources provided by OVC to grantees and partners throughout the nation has grown exponentially, as Congress has recognized the vital importance of expanding access to comprehensive victim services. Currently, OVC manages an unprecedented number of anti-trafficking projects and grants, working with an exceptional range of organizations — many of whom are represented actually in this room today — who are providing services to a record number of victims and survivors of human trafficking. The performance data OVC grantees report tells the story of the incredible volume of case management, housing, legal, employment, supportive and mental health services that they have provided. In the most recent reporting period, between July 2021 and June 2022, grantees reported assisting well over 16,000 individuals across the country. That’s a record-high number that reflects both the enormous impact of this funding but really illustrates a mere fraction of the harm that trafficking causes.  So, as everyone has said before me, while we have much to celebrate, we remember and use today to remember that still so much more must be done for the most vulnerable among us. Knowing that you all are committed to doing this work with us a great hope because you are the best of us, and you will move us from progress to promise.  I now have the pleasure of introducing my colleague Kristen Clarke, the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division, whose lawyers and prosecutor and staff have bene hard at work tacking human trafficking. So, please join me in welcoming AAG Clarke to the podium. Thank you.</span>

                                                                                                                     Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryGood afternoon.It is an honor to be here among you all today. Welcome to this anniversary commemoration to reflect on the department’s efforts to advance the nation’s response to human trafficking and for joining us in our enduring cause to help crime survivors find their justice.Thank you, Attorney General Garland, Associate Attorney General Gupta, Assistant Attorney General Clarke, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Solomon, Members of Congress, distinguished guests, colleagues, friends and fellow champions in our cause for joining us today.We observed Dr. King’s birthday earlier this month and it reminded me of his words.“We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always right to do right.”The Department of Justice, through its components, has built a multi-layered and robust response to the crime of human trafficking. Over the course of today’s program, you will hear about how DOJ, along with our federal partners, Congressional champions, stakeholders in the field, grantees and survivors of human trafficking have worked together over the past 20 years to ensure that survivors find healing and justice.OVC first started in the anti-trafficking field in 1998 when we awarded our very first grant with funding from the Victims of Crime Act, or VOCA. It wasn’t a lot of money, and you could say what we knew about trafficking at that time wasn’t much more. But we knew there were survivors in need, and that grant provided a path to assist them and a path for OVC to learn.Two years later, with the passage of the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act, we were able to develop, expand, and strengthen services to reach more survivors. And before we knew it, Congress appropriated $10 million dollars to OVC in 2002, and we dug in. The following year, in 2003, we funded the first 12 programs under the Services for Trafficking Victims Discretionary grant program.These programs were comprehensive, inclusive of all victims and all forms of human trafficking, and flexible so that service providers could be responsive to a wide array of needs.This marked the beginning of a new chapter in OVC’s history and an enhanced focus within our organization. Our aim was to raise awareness, identify survivors and connect them to much-needed services. In 2010, OVC partnered with the Bureau of Justice Assistance to begin co-funding what’s known as the Enhanced Collaborative Model to Combat Human Trafficking. These multi-disciplinary task forces use a holistic approach to identify victims of trafficking, address their unique needs, and prosecute cases at the federal, Tribal, state, and local levels.Working with all our partners across the country, we were able to identify strong or promising practices which share in resources such as the Development and Operations Roadmap for Multidisciplinary Anti-Human Trafficking Task Forces;  the Faces of Human Trafficking online video series and most recently our anti-trafficking graphic novels written for young survivors of trafficking to help them navigate the judicial system.Today, all of the Office of Justice Programs’ law enforcement, juvenile justice and victim services human trafficking initiatives are housed within OVC; collaborating and modeling the multi-disciplinary approach we promote in our programs. And we’ve gone from $10 million in 2003 to this year awarding over $90 million in grant funding. Our grantees have gone from serving just over 5,000 clients in 2016 to today serving an unprecedented 16,000 clients based on our most recent reporting period. Our Human Trafficking Division, lead by Brecht Donoghue, and made up of nine dedicated professionals manages approximately 500 grant awards worth $360 million. I know I may be a bit biased, but I believe our Human Trafficking Division is one of the hardest working teams in OJP. I’d like to ask the Human Trafficking Division staff who are here with us today, to stand and be acknowledged.  Now, that is truly something to celebrate.Getting to where we are in our country’s efforts to end human trafficking took all of us. It took the loud voices, the quiet voices, the sometimes shaking but still strong voices. It took the brave voices of those who survived, and those who spoke for the ones who could no longer. Your voices have been lifted up and have shaped what we know today and will form what we learn tomorrow.It took the work of victim service providers and advocates who walked side-by-side with survivors and created programs to meet their needs, wherever they were. Adapting, collaborating, expanding and innovating to make sure no one was left behind but, more importantly, to make certain that everybody was included.It took the work of health care providers who understood the unique physical and mental health care needs these patients often required. Recognizing that providing culturally responsive, patient-centered care is a critical component to meeting survivors where they are.It took the work of dedicated law enforcement officers and prosecutors who were trained in trauma-informed techniques. Knowing that justice may look different for each survivor but that everyone deserves the same access to that justice.It took law makers and appropriators who were open to the idea that combatting and responding to human trafficking is not just a whole of government concept but a whole of society imperative. Appreciating that funding is the lifeblood of these efforts and getting it in the hands of the people doing the work is not only a matter of how, but how fast.As far as we’ve come, and as much as we are here to celebrate the good work that has been done; it’s clear, we have miles to go and work yet to do to end trafficking and provide pathways towards healing. It will take all of us, and it will take all we’ve got.That’s why today we have arranged for you to hear – quoting Dr. King again, the “passionate concern of dedicated individuals” from Department of Justice leadership to pioneers and innovators in the field, to individuals who’ve survived. They’re going to talk about our theme today: Collaboration, Transformation, and Impact, and they are going to talk about how the funding made possible by Congress for services, training and technical assistance, is critical to moving the needle for survivors of human trafficking across the country.With that, it is my distinct honor to introduce our first speaker today. Now, as Attorney General you can imagine there are a few issues that require your time and attention. When it comes to matters that impact people, when it comes to survivors of crime, this Attorney General understands the importance of his presence. This, no doubt, comes from his firsthand experience working with victims of crime as both an AUSA and as the lead prosecutor on the Oklahoma City bombing cases. When you hear him talk about our duty to serve crime victims, you know you are listening to a true champion for justice. We thank you for speaking with us today on this important topic on this important occasion.Distinguished guests, it’s my pleasure to introduce the 86th Attorney General of the United States Merrick Garland.</span>

And welcome to Members of Congress, including Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, Attorney General Garland, Associate Attorney General Gupta, all of our esteemed guests. I am honored to join you in celebrating OVC’s tremendous achievements over the past two decades.Human trafficking is often described as a form of modern-day slavery because of the ways it degrades human dignity, erodes inalienable rights and subjects other human beings to a state of servitude. While slaveholders in the 18th and 19th centuries used whips, chains and physical restraints, contemporary trafficking crimes often rely on invisible schemes of deception, debts, threats and insidious forms of psychological manipulation to bind victims to perpetrators.  Traffickers target people of color, people who are experiencing homelessness or are facing substance abuse. They target those who are experiencing trauma from sexual or physical abuse, young people thrown out of their families for identifying as LGBTQ+. Traffickers manipulate individuals with cognitive disabilities, and they prey on persons with limited English proficiency or little access to education, or those who lack of immigration status, who are often unaware of the laws that protect them.Since the Civil Rights Division’s founding 65 years ago, enforcing these prohibitions against involuntary servitude have been a cornerstone of our mission as we’ve worked to uphold otherwise elusive Constitutional promises of freedom and equality. And after the passage of the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 expanded the statutory prohibitions and the tools available to the department, the division established a dedicated Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit to consolidate specialized anti-trafficking expertise. The unit has since been widely recognized, both nationally and globally, for advancing victim-centered, trauma-informed anti-trafficking strategies and for leading interagency enforcement initiatives to bring high-impact trafficking prosecutions, in partnership with our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices nationwide, in partnership with OVC and with other key anti-trafficking partners throughout the department and beyond. Just to underscore the urgency of this important work to bring traffickers to justice, earlier this week, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia sentenced three defendants to serve time in federal prison for conspiracy to commit forced labor for compelling the domestic labor of a Pakistani woman for 12 years. The defendants compelled the victim to serve the family as a domestic servant, using physical and verbal abuse, restricting her communication with her family back in her home country, confiscating her immigration documents, confiscating her money, threatening to separate her from her children by deporting her to Pakistan and more. They slapped, kicked and pushed the victim, even beat her with wooden board, and on one occasion hog-tied her hands and feet and dragged her down the stairs in front of her children. Last week, in an indictment that was unsealed in the Western District of Wisconsin, we charged a Wisconsin man with one count of labor trafficking for using force, threats of force and coercion to cause an adult woman to engage in forced labor for nearly two years.From the time of OVC’s formation, the division has worked hand-in-hand with OVC and other key partners to seek justice for human trafficking victims. Our work alongside OVC on behalf of trafficking victims and survivors is a natural extension of the division’s core mission of abolishing the legacy of slavery and servitude; upholding the Constitution; and vindicating the rights of the most vulnerable. As we emphasized many years ago when announcing the formation of the Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit,“Since the inception of the Civil Rights Division, [it] has led the fight against crimes that perpetuate a legacy of slavery and servitude. Whether these crimes took the form of lynchings and cross-burnings by night, or compelled servitude and bondage by day, they all entrenched a legacy of oppression against vulnerable members of our society. Modern-day slavery has taken on new forms … but the struggle remains the same – to vindicate the rights of marginalized members of our society who would otherwise have no voice, and who would otherwise be denied the guarantees of freedom and liberty that form the core of our Constitution.”Our close collaboration with OVC reflects the recognition that the three pillars of global anti-trafficking efforts — protecting victims, prosecuting perpetrators and preventing proliferation — are inseparable from each other and are all essential to our fight against human trafficking. In order to bring traffickers to justice, we must provide victims the protections they need to safely come forward and speak out against their traffickers. And in order to provide victims and other vulnerable people meaningful protection from trafficking threats, we must not only provide them assistance as they work to reclaim and rebuild their lives; we must also hold the perpetrators accountable for their crimes and dismantle trafficking enterprises so they cannot revert to victimizing others.To give an example of what such accountability looks like, in December, a federal judge sentenced an Alabama trafficker to 60 years in prison and ordered him to pay almost a million dollars in restitution to five victims in a case prosecuted by the department. The trafficker targeted women struggling with substance abuse issues and preyed upon them by increasing their heroin use. Then the trafficker withheld opioids from the victims to induce extremely painful withdrawal sickness and compel them to engage in commercial sex. He beat the women and threatened to send sexually explicit images of them to their families. At trial, the victims testified courageously against the trafficker. The victims remain in recovery to this today, and they are now on the road to reclaiming their lives – thanks in part to the services and support they received. One now works for the organization that helped her, working to aid other victims. And that is the lasting impact of collaboration.So, this work requires strong partnerships, and OVC’s work in funding victim service providers and training task force partners has proven vital to identifying, stabilizing and supporting more survivors than ever before. OVC’s efforts, in collaboration with victim service grantees — including some who are here today — are essential to empowering survivors to speak out against their traffickers, often enabling them to testify as witnesses in criminal cases.In recent years, we’ve also worked closely with OVC to amplify the voices of survivors and incorporate the survivor expertise into our work and into ability to detect, investigate, and prosecute these cases. And we’re grateful for OVC’s role in expanding the ongoing dialogue among survivor-experts, victim specialists and law enforcement as we work to strengthen our collective anti-trafficking work.We know from experience that this collaboration has made a profound difference on victims’ lives. As one survivor said about the experience of working with the department and when writing her victim impact statement, “I thank God that there were noble people like you guys to see that justice is served and there to help us and value us, and thanks to you, I had the strength to write this statement.”We’re honored to take a part in this celebration of OVC, its work and its accomplishments over the past two decades and look forward to building on this partnership and continuing the fight in the road ahead as we work to pursue justice for victims and survivors of human trafficking.Thank you so much.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 4 Remarks as Prepared for Delivery Thank you for that kind introduction. It’s a pleasure to be with you today.At the outset, let me congratulate you, Alden, and the staff of the Mercatus Center for putting together today’s program. You’ve brought together thoughtful antitrust lawyers and scholars for what is no doubt an interesting discussion about antitrust enforcement and competition policy.In preparation for today’s program, I took the opportunity to learn more about the Mercatus Center’s mission and work. Devoted to “market-oriented ideas,” its research focuses on “how markets solve problems.”[1]You might wonder then how—or even why—someone like me, a federal antitrust enforcer with an admittedly pro-enforcement outlook, finds herself at this sort of confab. But that is the wonderful thing about today’s program. Notwithstanding its worldview, the Center invites people of different viewpoints to share ideas and learning.For that, I commend you and thank you for bringing all of us together. In times of social, political, and economic polarization, candid conversations like this one are an especially important public good. That is also why I chose this event to give my first significant address as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Antitrust Division.I. IntroductionWe are so fortunate to practice in a time when debates about corporate power, antitrust enforcement, and the operation of markets enjoy such prominence in the public consciousness.These issues and debates, of course, are not new to us. But in the last several years, the discussions have spilled onto kitchen tables across the country, our social media feeds, and of course our news media of choice.Setting enforcement policy is a tremendous honor; with it comes tremendous responsibility, especially at a time when competition issues feature so prominently in our national dialogue. That is why drawing in a wide swath of viewpoints, including from those who live under the market structures and conditions that our enforcement and policy choices beget, is so important. That was the central thesis behind the agencies’ merger guidelines RFI process. Feedback sharpens our thinking, vets our assumptions, and, ultimately, leads to better considered policy judgments.In this vein, I acknowledge there is a lot on which we may not agree. But one of my core beliefs and governing principles is that more unites than divides us. And I think that’s particularly true when it comes to the axioms of competition policy.Let me explain.In my conversations, I sometimes hear two competing views about the role of corporations. These views loosely affiliate with different ends of the political spectrum, though not exclusively so. Some may view corporations as inherently greedy. Extractive corporations take from consumers and workers alike, entrenching their position by using power for harmful ends. Others don’t see that profit motive as a bad thing. They subscribe to Milton Friedman’s famous line that “the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.”[2] The invisible hand of the market, they say, transforms that self-promoting corporate conduct into something that benefits all of society.What strikes me about these competing views, though, is that they share a common prescription: the vast majority of people believe, or at least say they believe, in the value of competition. Whether you are skeptical about the power of government or of corporate power, you likely attach some value to the rivalry between firms, and the benefits that rivalry can produce. If you see corporate motives as suspect, competition keeps corporations in check. And if you believe in less government intervention, you might also believe that competition and antitrust enforcement are alternatives to regulation.Congress understood the value of competition and enshrined it in the Sherman and Clayton Acts. The Supreme Court, putting these concepts together, explained the necessity of free and unfettered competition.[3] “[T]he unrestrained interaction of competitive forces,” it said, “will yield the best allocation of our economic resources, the lowest prices, the highest quality and the greatest material progress, while at the same time providing an environment conductive to the preservation of our democratic political and social institutions.”[4] “But even were that premise open to question,” the majority wrote, “the policy unequivocally laid down by the Act is competition.”[5]Maintaining competition is precisely the aim of the Clayton Act as well. Markets that are hobbled by anticompetitive restraints and concentrated by mergers cannot be expected to do what we want them to do. It is for that reason that Section 7 outlaws mergers that “may” operate “substantially to lessen competition” or “tend to create a monopoly.”[6] This is not a controversial mandate. For all the divisions that exist, the vast majority of people, of all stripes, seem to agree that markets should operate free of anticompetitive constraints and illegal market power.But for years enforcers and courts hesitated to fully realize this mandate. If you look around today, my guess is that you can identify plenty of markets that are not yielding the “best allocation of our economic resources” or characterized by the “lowest prices [and] the highest quality.” In my view, that is because we have often enough perceived the possibility that mergers may be illegal, but we have declined to wield the power Congress gave us. In the worst cases, we have usurped the will of Congress, intentionally underenforcing the antitrust laws by administrative fiat. In other cases, we have tried to make predictive judgments about the likelihood of harm—more specifically when anticompetitive effects might not come to pass. In such cases, increasingly we raised the standard that Congress explicitly set forth, requiring something near certainty about the effects of a merger to block it.Today, I’d like to talk through some examples of times when our reliance on predictions have failed us. I’ll then offer some suggestions for how we might think about an antitrust framework that is fit for purpose.I won’t hide my thesis. I’ve been at the Antitrust Division for nearly eight years. I’ve seen different approaches to antitrust enforcement and competition policy. What I know is there’s no Delorean with a flux capacitor sitting in the Antitrust Division’s metaphorical driveway. We don’t have Bill and Ted’s phone booth. When we try to predict to near certainty the precise effects of a deal, we can get it wrong.The question, of course, is what lesson to take from it. Perhaps, you say, if we can’t be certain about the ultimate effects of a merger, we should hang back and let market forces play out.To that I say: it is easier to assess competition than to predict to a near certainty the competitive effects of a deal in a dynamic world. It is also more consistent with the framework that Congress set forth.Congress was wise to this quandary. It knew the future of a marketplace is hard to predict, and believed that waiting for conduct to actually ripen into harm was an inadequate way to realize its goals. So, in passing the Clayton Act, it wrote a probabilistic statute that expressly did not require certainty about what happened in the future. Congress prohibited any merger whose effect “may be”—and those words, “may be,” are critical—substantially to lessen competition. Does that mean we prohibit more mergers than we would need to if we had a crystal ball that perfectly predicted the future? Of course. There is nothing radical about that approach. That was Congress’s design. As the Supreme Court explained, the Clayton Act is concerned “with probabilities, not certainties.”[7] Congress’s judgment was that we, in the words of the Supreme Court, need “to brake th[e] force” of “concentration in American business … at its outset and before it gathered momentum.”[8]I think we have often failed to take this standard at its word. And all too often, the exact harm we were concerned about, but predicted might not materialize, did. That is radical. I can think of no other substantive area of law so central to our economy and society that was nonetheless intentionally underenforced.We must take Congress’s will seriously. Here’s what that means in practice. When we look out and see various reasonably probable outcomes from a transaction, if one of them is a substantial lessening of competition, we should have a bias towards action. Section 7 doesn’t require certainty. It very well may be the case that no change in competition is also a possible outcome. Even that is not a bar to enforcement. We don’t need to ask what is the most likely outcome. We should not let a temptation to be crystal ball seers cloud our Congressionally-directed mission.II. Lessons from the pastTo illustrate this problem, I’d like to offer three examples.1. Digital Advertising: Google/DoubleClick and Google/AdMeldEarlier this week, we filed a landmark monopolization lawsuit against Google. Our complaint alleges in rich detail that, over the last 15 years, Google has unlawfully acquired and maintained monopoly power in digital advertising technologies.So, what happened 15 years ago? Google acquired DoubleClick, which was then the “leading firm in the third party ad serving markets.”[9] This acquisition was a turning point. As we alleged in our complaint, it “vaulted Google into a commanding position over the tools [website] publishers use to sell advertising” and “set the stage for Google’s later exclusionary conduct across the ad tech industry.”[10]Our investigation, of course, is not the first time an antitrust enforcer considered whether the DoubleClick acquisition would lead to anticompetitive ends. The FTC investigated the deal in 2007. As the Commission’s statements from the time make clear, they understood the possibility of harm even then. In fact, Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbour dissented from the Commission’s decision to close the investigation because “the combination of Google and DoubleClick has the potential to profoundly alter the 21st century Internet-based economy.”[11] Her clairvoyance was striking.Nevertheless, a majority of Commissioners predicted that these harms were unlikely. We know differently today.For example, the majority identified the risk that Google would “bundle or tie DoubleClick’s ad serving technology” to enhance its own position, or “leverage DoubleClick’s leading position in third party ad serving to its advantage in the ad intermediation market.”[12] But despite acknowledging this risk, the Commission did not take action because it was not certain this harm would come about. Now compare that prediction with what actually happened, as alleged in our complaint. After acquiring DoubleClick, “Google forged an exclusive link between Google Ads”—its homegrown, market-leading product—“and DFP through the AdX ad exchange”—the two products it acquired from DoubleClick.[13] As alleged in our complaint, and as Commissioner Harbour predicted, this move had “a profound effect on the evolution of digital advertising.”[14] It “tilted the industry in Google’s favor, driving publishers to adopt and stay on Google’s DFP publisher ad server in order to have access to Google Ads’ advertiser demand.”[15] And it “cut off the possibility that Google Ads’ advertising spending could sustain, or encourage the entry of, a rival ad exchange or publisher ad server.”[16]The FTC explained its reticence to take action. It predicted that the ad intermediation market was “unlikely to ‘tip’”[17] and that the third party ad serving markets were “competitive and … likely to become even more so in the future.”[18] Not so. Again, compare these statements with what actually happened, as alleged in our complaint. Because of Google’s conduct, DFP became the “only realistic publisher ad server option.”[19] Its share, according to Google’s own documents, grew to “a remarkable 90%,” which gave Google a “durable monopoly over the publisher ad server market.”[20]I could go on. The majority’s statement and the dissent read as a roadmap of the conduct Google actually undertook. Remarkably, it was clear to everyone what Google might do but, still, a majority of Commissioners wanted more certainty.I do not mean to call out the FTC. As citizens, we owe the FTC a huge debt of gratitude for its work to protect consumers. It is a tremendous agency whose staff and leadership over the years have engaged thoughtfully and deliberatively about the challenges of the moment. Its challenges are hardly exclusive.We at the Antitrust Division have fallen prey to the same thinking—with the exact same company. Just a few years after the DoubleClick acquisition, Google announced another step in its path toward dominance: the acquisition of AdMeld. AdMeld competed with Google to provide services to web publishers that facilitated the sale of display advertising space. We at the Division, like the FTC, identified a reasonable possibility of antitrust harm. But we thought this risk would not turn into reality. We predicted that “multi-homing,” a practice in which publishers would rely on multiple display advertising platforms, would “lessen[] the risk that the market will tip to a single dominant platform.”[21] We were wrong. “Google’s increasing scale and dominance across the ad tech stack, coupled with its subsequent exclusionary conduct, destroyed the ability of advertisers and publishers to effectively multi-home among alternative ad exchanges.”[22] As alleged in this week’s complaint, Google “folded [AdMeld’s] functionality into Google’s existing products, and then shut down its operations with non-Google ad exchanges and advertiser tools.”[23] And what happened? “As a result, the market tipped and AdX became the dominant ad exchange.”[24] As we allege in the complaint, “Google’s AdX is the largest ad exchange in the market; it is approximately four times larger than the next largest ad exchange . . . and has been for at least several years.”[25]2. Entertainment: AT&amp;amp;T/Time-WarnerEven in full-blown trials, we see courts encounter the same challenges.In 2017, the Division sued to block the merger of AT&amp;amp;T and Time Warner. At the time, the case was the first litigated vertical merger challenge in more than 40 years. Our theory of harm focused on the value of Time Warner’s entertainment content. We alleged that if AT&amp;amp;T were able to pull Time Warner content from AT&amp;amp;T’s content distribution rivals—called a “blackout”—it would drive those rivals’ customers to AT&amp;amp;T. We alleged that this was an incentive built into the structure of the market.The Court did not challenge the legal viability of this theory. Nor did it dispute that there was some risk of this anticompetitive harm occurring. But, instead of blocking the merger, it relied on testimony from the companies’ executives to make a prediction: There “is likely never going to be[] an actual long-term blackout of Turner content,” it said, referring to a division of Time Warner.[26]A blackout of Time Warner content is exactly what happened. Less than six months after AT&amp;amp;T consummated the transaction, it pulled HBO from all Dish networks, starting a multi-year blackout of Time Warner content.[27] This was the first blackout in HBO’s 43-year history. And it was decidedly “long-term.” Lasting nearly three years, it became “one of the longest-running carriage disputes in TV history.”[28]This should have come as no surprise. AT&amp;amp;T owned DirecTV, Dish’s primary rival for satellite TV. And the blackout, in the words of the Wall Street Journal, created an incentive for Dish “viewers … to drift to rivals like AT&amp;amp;T’s DirecTV.”[29] Dish itself blamed the power created by the merger for AT&amp;amp;T’s conduct: “Plain and simple, the merger created for AT&amp;amp;T immense power,” it claimed, and “AT&amp;amp;T is implementing a new strategy to shut off its recently acquired content from other distributors.”[30]One other aspect of this case is worth mentioning: the predictions of efficiencies advanced by the parties and entertained by the court. After rejecting the Division’s theory of harm, the court predicted that the merger would yield “most, if not all” of the $1.5 billion in cost-savings suggested by the parties.[31] The merger, the companies and court seemed to say, would create a hyper-efficient body capable of delivering superior product to consumers.Of course, we know how the story ended. Just three years after the merger was consummated, the companies reversed course. AT&amp;amp;T sold Time Warner, leading at least one national newspaper to wonder whether “this $100 billion deal [was] the worst merger ever.”[32]I would be remiss if I did not pause to reflect on the sentiment at the time this lawsuit was filed. The wisdom of the merger challenge was the subject of significant speculation and writing. Suffice it to say, I hope and believe history will vindicate the Antitrust Division, its tremendous staff, and my former boss Assistant Attorney General Delrahim who had the courage to bring the challenge.3. Beer: Miller/CoorsThe limits of our predictive power surface in other industries too. Consider beer.In 2008, the Division investigated a joint venture between Miller and Coors. We found that the two companies were close competitors—competition that would be lost after the transaction. We nonetheless allowed the deal to go forward on the theory that “the joint venture is likely to produce substantial and credible savings that will significantly reduce the companies’ costs of producing and distributing beer,” which would, in turn, “have a beneficial effect on prices.”[33]Did this “beneficial effect on prices” materialize? Not according to a 2017 merger retrospective by economists Nathan Miller and Matthew Weinberg. The authors found precisely the opposite. They document an “abrupt[]” increase in prices right after the deal was consummated.[34]  Importantly, these price increases were not only the result of unilateral effects—they also were evident in MillerCoors’ major competitor, Anheuser-Busch, suggesting coordinated effects.[35]III. The Path ForwardSo where does all of this leave us? I believe there are five lessons we can draw. 1. Congress says what it means and means what it says. We need to enforce the statute as Congress wrote it. Decades of Supreme Court precedent speak to the need to arrest concentration and trends towards concentration in their incipiency. In many cases, including those I’ve described today, agencies and courts accurately identified a risk to competition, but did not act because they weren’t sufficiently certain the harm would come to pass.But that is not the standard. Congress wrote a statute that applies whenever a merger “may” substantially lessen competition. It’s an incipiency statute. Congress was concerned that, if we wait until the harm has actually come about, it would be too late.We cannot wait for evidence that harm is sure to exist. It’s the rare case that we will see documentary evidence laying out a post-merger price hike or a plan to shutter innovation or diminish quality. That puts a premium on the value of structural evidence. When a change in market structure suggests that a firm will have an incentive to reduce competition, that should be enough. Congress did not write a statute asking whether a substantial lessening of competition was “certain” or the “most likely” outcome. As long as that harm “may” occur, the merger violates the law and should be enjoined.2. Accept that firms will exercise their market power.In every merger review, our core inquiry is: how does competition present itself in this industry? Once we see that a merger may lead to, or increase, a firm’s market power, only in very rare circumstances should we think that a firm will not exercise that power. Too often, judgments that a firm will obtain market power, but somehow not exercise it, have turned out to be wrong.Here’s what that means in more concrete terms. In the vast majority of circumstances, promises that companies will not exercise their market power, including for reasons of professed reputational concerns, should not be a viable defense to an otherwise anticompetitive merger. Reputation evidence, such as it is, is often too fleeting, too fickle, and too malleable to protect the public from illegal mergers and abuses of market power.The same is true of executive testimony and corporate promises to continue competing or freeze prices. Like reputation evidence, it puts the public at the mercy of the merged firm. Simply put, there is no guarantee that an executive’s view today will remain the company’s plan tomorrow.3. The structural presumption is an important proxy for market power.While competition analysis is more dynamic than static, information about market structure can help screen off the risks of unilateral effects and the likelihood of future oligopolistic behavior. The structural presumption, like other bright lines and rules, also helps businesses conform their conduct to the law with more confidence about how the agencies will view a proposed merger or conduct. Again, I come back to my thesis. It is easier to measure competition than to predict competitive effects in a dynamic world, and that is more consistent with the framework that Congress set forth.4. Be skeptical of efficiencies.When we think a merger may substantially lessen competition, the optimal remedy is to block it. Sometimes, I’ve heard a suggestion that a merger should be permitted, even though it decreases competition, because it creates efficiencies for the merged firm. This is not, however, the scheme Congress envisioned. It is competition that Congress wanted to preserve. Not efficiency. The Clayton Act does not ask whether a merger creates a more or less efficient firm—it asks about the effect of the merger on competition. The Supreme Court has never recognized efficiencies as a defense to an otherwise illegal merger. And in the exceedingly rare instances when low courts have considered them, they have explained that there is a high burden for demonstrating that efficiencies increase competition. ​​​​​​​5. We must be willing to litigate.Too often, instead of litigating to stop an anticompetitive merger, we have relied on consent decrees to try to fix the problem. We have relied on a prediction about what schemes would address, in the future, the structural issues created by a merger. Again, we have too often been wrong. The FTC’s own study on remedies, released in 2017, found that when the Commission relied on divestitures of limited packages of assets in horizontal, non-consummated mergers, the scheme failed to restore competition almost one third of the time.[36] Other studies released at the time suggested an even greater failure rate.Litigation is intrinsically risky. Enforcing a probabilistic statue comes with an inherent risk that a court will see probabilities differently. Perhaps our desire for certainty in merger enforcement was born out of this fear. But if we only challenge the cases in which we’re nearly positive that anticompetitive harm will come to pass, we’re not enforcing the law as Congress wrote it.If we take our mandate seriously, we need to acknowledge the possibility that sometimes a court might not agree with us—and yet go to court anyway.*          *          *At the Division, we are putting these principles to work. We are taking action when we think mergers imperil competition. We are not relying on untested efficiencies to approve mergers, nor are we coming up with predictions for why firms might not exercise the market power a merger gives them. When we see a reasonable probability that a merger may harm competition, our bias is to protect competition.And we are having success. In the recent Penguin Random House/Simon &amp;amp; Schuster merger, our investigation showed that the acquisition would have enabled Penguin, which was already the largest book publisher in the world, to exert outsized influence over which books are published in the United States and how much authors are paid for their work.[37] So we took the parties to court. And we won. This victory was important because it was principally a merger challenge about monopsony power.In other matters, parties have abandoned mergers after we expressed competition concerns. Cargotec and Konecranes proposed a merger that we believed threatened to harm competition in the sale of shipping container handling equipment, which is critical to the global supply chain. The parties ultimately abandoned the deal.[38] When Verzatec, a producer and seller of pebbled fiberglass reinforced plastic wall panels sought to acquire its biggest competitor, Crane, we filed suit under both Section 7 and Section 2.[39] There, too, the parties walked away. And, similarly, when two of the world’s four suppliers of insulated container boxes and refrigerated shipping containers sought to merge, the Division conducted a thorough investigation, prompting the parties to abandon.[40] In all of these cases, we observed the risk of harm to competition and focused on taking action.Of course, not all cases will turn out in our favor. The fact that we have not won every case we have brought is, to me, a feature, and not a bug, of our approach to enforcing the law Congress wrote. The desire for certainty is at least one root cause of our underenforcement in recent years.Here’s what I’d like to leave with you today. We share a common goal in protecting competitive markets. We share a belief that companies should be able to compete on the merits and the best ones should win. And I suspect we also agree that the world, and our economy, are complex, and we are enforcement cannot be conditioned on reliably predicting the effects of deals with certainty.If we do indeed share these premises, I’d like you to consider the prescription I’ve given about the way forward: it is easier to measure competition than to predict competitive effects in a dynamic world, and that is more consistent with the framework that Congress set forth.From my experience, when we demand certainty, we raise the standards for enforcement well beyond what the statute contemplates and we underenforce the law. Congress wrote a statute concerned with probabilities and focused on stopping incipient threats.      As the saying goes, the time is late and I must be going now.Let me close by saying what an honor it is to be with you.

                                                                                                                                         Good morning! I am delighted to be with you all in New Orleans, the traditional and sacred homeland of the Chitimacha, Choctaw, Houma, and Biloxi peoples.I believe it is crucial that we acknowledge the original, rightful and continuing stewards of this land. However, that acknowledgment means little if not accompanied by action following the leadership of Tribal advocates and survivors.That is why it is so important for OVW to be here: to be guided by the voices of all who are here in this room today.Our work is driven by the principle that we cannot end violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women without centering Tribal sovereignty. And all OVW’s work – not just our Tribal Affairs Division but all our grants and policies – are only effective when they are informed by Tribal leaders and designees.In that vein, under the Violence Against Women Act – or VAWA – the Department of Justice, in coordination with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services, holds an annual government-to-government consultation with Tribal leaders on responding to violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women. OVW is honored to plan and host the consultation, which we held in Alaska for the first time ever last year.Every year at consultation, we hear powerful and sometimes heartbreaking testimony from Tribal leaders and designees who are living through the unbearable devastation of losing a loved one – of not knowing if someone missing will ever return.We cannot underestimate the role that sex trafficking has in these cases. Years ago, the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition (MIWSAC) was the first to tell me about the shocking rates of sex trafficking in Indian Country: MIWSAC told me that girls were being recruited or even abducted while waiting for the bus. MIWSAC is still leading the way in documenting the problem and identifying strategies to stop it.This year, we conducted site visits in Alaska, and we heard that Alaska Native youth who leave home for Anchorage are approached by traffickers within days of arriving. We heard about Alaska Native youth in foster care in Ketchikan who had been trafficked, though they wouldn’t have defined themselves as victims and needed culturally specific responses that met them where they were. And we heard about the role of fishing fleets and extractive industries in exacerbating sex trafficking.Tribes need tools to address this.Last year, VAWA was reauthorized and restored Tribes’ inherent sovereign jurisdiction to Tribes to prosecute non-Indian perpetrators of sex trafficking, among other offenses – including sexual violence and child abuse in the context of domestic violence – committed on Tribal lands.The law also expands this jurisdiction to Alaska Native villages, who were left out of the previous legal framework. These victories for Tribal sovereignty are thanks to the determined advocacy of so many represented at this conference.If you have ever doubted that your voice counts in Washington, just look at VAWA. People said it couldn’t be done but you made it happen.And you worked for these historic wins because you are in community with those who are directly impacted. You yourselves are impacted. You are supporting survivors every day, and COVID-19 introduced an entirely new set of shifting circumstances for you to overcome.So, I want to thank you not only for your work on VAWA 2022, but for being here today, and my special thanks to Nicole Matthews and everyone at MIWSAC, Men as Peacemakers, the Tribal Law and Policy Institute and Mending the Sacred Hoop for bringing us together for this incredibly important conference.Addressing the disproportionately high rates of violence experienced by Indigenous people, including sexual violence and sex trafficking and relatedly, the high rates of Indigenous people who are missing, is a priority not just for OVW but for the entire Department of Justice.The missing and murdered Indigenous persons – or MMIP – crisis requires trauma-informed, victim-centered responses from across the Department of Justice.Last year, the Department launched an MMIP page with helpful resources for survivors and their loved ones, Tribal communities, law enforcement agencies and officers, and service providers. That can be found at justice.gov/Tribal/mmip.But we know we have much more to do, and we are guided in that work by the words of Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, in her directive creating a Justice Department Steering Committee to address the MMIP crisis, “The Department recognizes that challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions, and the Steering Committee should therefore make Tribal engagement the cornerstone of its work.” I want to reiterate, “the challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions.”I serve on the Not Invisible Act Commission, and I am proud to see those Tribal solutions at the heart of the commission’s work.But of course, those Tribal solutions need funding to succeed, and we want to support you. We want to invest in you and help you succeed once you get those federal funds. We are posting new grant solicitations – some are already online now – and I must encourage you to apply. Most of our grants prioritize Tribal organizations or Tribal governments in some way, so please look at all our available solicitations and not just the ones specific to Tribes. Information on our grants, purpose areas, and how to apply can all be found on our website, and we’ve brought informational material for you to take.I’ve been an applicant and a grantee myself, so I know it’s not as easy as just saying “apply!” We are working hard to make applications simpler, and our Tribal Affairs Division has done great work to revise and streamline applications – particularly for our grants to support Tribes in implementing that newly broadened special Tribal criminal jurisdiction.Another opportunity to build your own capacity and help OVW fund more Tribal organizations is to be a peer reviewer of grant applications. The peer review process involves active professionals from the field assessing applications against the criteria in the solicitation and selecting the best in the pool. When you serve as a peer reviewer, you get a behind-the-scenes look at how to be a successful applicant.You also bring your unique expertise. You help ensure that applications from Tribes and Tribal organizations are being reviewed by people who understand those communities, by people from those very communities, by people who know what culturally specific services look like. You can visit OVW’s website for more information and fill out the recruitment form to submit via email.I want to close by thanking the survivors in the audience. To everyone who has struggled and is here today to turn that pain into action: we see you. We stand with you. We will fight side by side with you. We are going to change the world together.Thank you.</span>

                                                                        Good afternoon.Unfortunately, I am going to begin my remarks today just as I did yesterday: offering my condolences to the families of the victims of yet another mass shooting in our country.All of us at the Justice Department, including the FBI and ATF, will continue to support the Half Moon Bay community in the difficult days ahead. And as I said yesterday, the Justice Department is committed to doing everything in our power to protect our communities from the gun violence that is leaving no community in this country untouched.Today, the Department of Justice, joined by eight states, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Google.We allege that Google has used anticompetitive, exclusionary, and unlawful conduct to eliminate or severely diminish any threat to its dominance over digital advertising technologies.These technologies, which are known as “ad tech,” automate advertising sales by website publishers to online advertisers.When an internet user opens a webpage that has ad space to sell, ad tech tools almost instantly match the website publisher with an advertiser looking to promote its products or services to the website's user.  This product and process typically involves the use of an automated advertising exchange. This exchange runs a high-speed auction designed to identify the best match between a publisher selling internet ad space and advertisers looking to buy it.As alleged in our complaint, for 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anticompetitive conduct that has allowed it to halt the rise of rival technologies, manipulate auction mechanics to insulate itself from competition, and force advertisers and publishers to use its tools.In so doing, Google has engaged in exclusionary conduct to severely weaken, if not destroy, competition in the ad tech industry.As detailed in our complaint, we allege that Google's anticompetitive conduct extends to three significant elements of the digital ad buying process.First, Google controls the technology used by nearly every major website publisher to offer advertising space for sale.Second, Google controls the leading tool used by advertisers to buy that advertising space.And, third, Google controls the largest ad exchange that matches publishers and advertisers together each time that ad space is sold.As a result of this scheme, website creators earn less, and advertisers pay more. That means fewer publishers are able to offer internet users content without subscriptions, paywalls, or other forms of monetization.Our complaint alleges that Google has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by:Monopolizing the market for the technology used by publishers to offer ads on their websites;Monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the ad exchange market; andMonopolizing the market for the ad network technology advertisers use to buy digital advertising space.  Our complaint also alleges that Google has unlawfully tied its ad exchange and its publisher ad server, in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. And finally, we allege that the United States, as an advertiser, has incurred damages by reason of Google's violations of the antitrust laws. In addition to declaratory relief, our complaint seeks damages and the divestiture of certain Google ad tech products. It also seeks an injunction preventing Google from continuing to engage in the anticompetitive practices described in the complaint, and any other practices with the same purpose and effect as the challenged practices.I am grateful to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Doha Mekki, and the attorneys and staff of the Antitrust Division for their tireless work on this case.Monopolies threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation, they hurt producers and workers, and they increase costs for consumers.Today's complaint is only the latest example of the Department's work to challenge antitrust violations that undermine competition and harm the American people.No matter the industry and no matter the company, the Justice Department will vigorously enforce our antitrust laws. We will aggressively protect consumers, safeguard competition, and work to ensure economic fairness and opportunity for all.I will now turn the podium over to Associate Attorney General Vanita Gupta.</span>
