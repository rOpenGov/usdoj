And finally, they demanded a ransom payment in exchange for a system decryption key and a promise not to publish any stolen data.Hive affiliates targeted critical infrastructure and some of our nation's most important industries.In one instance in August 2021, Hive affiliates deployed ransomware on computers owned by a Midwest hospital. At a time when COVID-19 was surging in communities around the world, the Hive ransomware attack prevented this hospital from accepting any new patients. The hospital was also forced to rely on paper copies of patient information. It was only able to recover its data after it paid a ransom.Hive’s most recent victim in the Central District of California was attacked on or about December 30 of last year. Its most recent victim in the [Middle] District of Florida was attacked around 15 days ago.In its first year of operation, Hive extorted over $100 million in ransom payments from its victims.           Last summer, FBI agents from the Tampa Division, with the support of prosecutors in the Criminal Division's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section and the Middle District of Florida infiltrated the Hive network and began disrupting Hive’s attempts to extort victims. For example, the FBI disrupted a Hive ransomware attack against a Texas school district’s computer systems. The Bureau provided decryption keys to the school district, saving it from making a $5 million ransom payment.That same month, the FBI disrupted a Hive ransomware attack on a Louisiana hospital, saving the victim from a $3 million ransom payment.The FBI was also able to disrupt an attack on a food services company. The Bureau provided the company with decryption keys and saved the victim from a $10 million ransom payment.Since July of last year, we provided assistance to over 300 victims around the world, helping to prevent approximately $130 million in ransom payments.Our continued investigative efforts led us to two back-end computer servers located in Los Angeles that were used by Hive to store the network’s critical information. Last night, pursuant to a court order, we seized those servers. We also received court authorization to wrest control of Hive's darknet sites and render its services unavailable.This morning, if a Hive affiliate tries to access their darknet site, this is what they will see.Our investigation into the criminal conduct of Hive members remains ongoing.I want to thank all of the agents, prosecutors, and staff across the Department for their work on this matter. I also want to thank the United States Secret Service, as well as all of our international partners, including Germany and the Netherlands, as well as our law enforcement partners at Europol.Cybercrime is a constantly evolving threat. But as I have said before, the Justice Department will spare no resource to identify and bring to justice, anyone, anywhere, who targets the United States with a ransomware attack.  We will continue to work both to prevent these attacks and to provide support to victims who have been targeted.And together with our international partners, we will continue to disrupt the criminal networks that deploy these attacks.I’m now going to turn over the podium over to Deputy Attorney General Monaco.</span>

 Remarks as Prepared for DeliveryThank you, Mr. Attorney General.Over the last two years, the Attorney General and I have made clear that the department will use all the tools at its disposal, and work with partners to attack the ransomware threat from every angle.The department’s agents, prosecutors, and trial attorneys have partnered with law enforcement allies across the globe:To track ransom payments through the block chain and seize them back for victims;\tTo dismantle ransomware networks;\tTo warn targets of exigent ransomware threats to prevent attacks;\tAnd to disrupt the criminal ecosystem that enables the targeting of innocent victims.We’ve made it clear that we will strike back against cyber crime using any means possible — today’s action reflects that strategy.We have also pledged to place victims at the center of our mission and prioritize prevention.As you’ll hear the FBI Director explain in greater detail, for the past several months the FBI and our prosecutors have been inside the network of one of the world’s most prolific ransomware variants: Hive.The FBI has labeled Hive a top 5 ransomware threat — both for its technical sophistication and for the harm it can inflict on victims.But, for all the group’s technical prowess, it could not outfox our prosecutors, our agents, and our international law enforcement coalition.Unbeknownst to HIVE, in a 21st century cyber stakeout, our investigative team lawfully infiltrated Hive’s network and hid there for months — repeatedly swiping decryption keys and passing them to victims to free them from ransomware.For months, we helped victims defeat their attackers and deprived the Hive network of extortion profits.Simply put, using lawful means, we hacked the hackers.We turned the tables on Hive and busted their business model, saving potential victims approximately $130 million dollars in ransomware payments.Successful actions like the one we announce today require the creative use of civil and criminal authorities, and they require partnerships – among law enforcement to be sure – but also with victims.Our actions in this investigation should speak clearly to those victims: it pays to come forward, and work with us.We are all in this together – we need your help to stop cybercriminals, to prevent future victims. In exchange, we pledge our tireless efforts to help you protect your systems and prevent or recover losses.When a victim steps forward it can make all the difference in recovering stolen funds or obtaining decryptor keys.Whether you own a small business, run a Fortune 500 company, oversee a school district, or manage a hospital — we can work with you to counter ransomware, mitigate harm, prevent losses, and strike back at the bad guys.Although today’s announcement marks an important success in the international fight against ransomware, we will not rest when it comes to Hive and its affiliates.If you target victims here in the United States, the Department of Justice will target you.And if you are a victim, know that the Department of Justice and the FBI are on the job, and we’ll be fighting for you and alongside you throughout your time of crisis.I’ll now turn the podium over to Director Wray.</span>

I’m Amy Solomon, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Justice Programs. I am so pleased to be part of this commemoration and to have the privilege of bringing today’s inspiring event to a close.I want to thank Kris Rose and our amazing team in the Office for Victims of Crime for making this day possible. And I’m grateful for the words of support and encouragement from our Attorney General, the Associate Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General Clarke. You can see that our commitment to human trafficking victims is truly embraced at the highest levels of the Department of Justice.We are, of course, very thankful to our speakers for giving us so much to think about and for motivating us to action. And we are grateful to everyone in this room for your leadership in your communities and for the work you do every day on behalf of human trafficking survivors.As our speakers have made clear, this work has never been more important. The more we learn about human trafficking, the more we appreciate the toll it takes on families, on communities and, especially, on individuals.But as we have heard today, these challenges can be eased through the support of compassionate providers, well-trained professionals and intentional action at all levels of government – and just as important, by amplifying the voices of survivors themselves.OVC is working hard, every day and in partnership with so many of you, to lift up the voices of human trafficking victims. OVC has grounded their programs and activities in what survivors tell us, improving and supporting responses that are trauma-informed, victim-centered, culturally relevant and tailored to the unique needs of every victim from every community.For example, the voices of survivors serve as the foundation for the National Standards of Care for Anti-Trafficking Service Providers, which ensures greater coordination and continuity of care and assistance. These standards are being developed in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office on Trafficking in Persons and will be informed by people with lived experience. They will articulate our expectation that federally-funded services should always be victim-centered and developmentally, culturally and linguistically appropriate.OVC’s contributions and leadership, and the contributions of everyone in this room, continue to move the field forward. Today, we are responding to human trafficking victims with deeper understanding of their needs, obstacles and interests. We’re providing more effective services and wider access to resources. And we’re helping to deliver a greater measure of justice to human trafficking survivors and a very real hope for a safer and brighter future.We have done this together, and I believe that the next 20 years will continue to advance the tremendous progress we have made over the last 20. I could not be more proud of what we have accomplished together, and I look forward to what we will achieve in the years ahead.I thank you all for being part of today’s commemoration, and on behalf of all of us at the Department of Justice, thank you for everything you do to support and assist survivors of human trafficking every day.This concludes our ceremony.</span>

And we recognize 20 years of anti-trafficking programs by the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime.Human trafficking is a heinous crime with devastating consequences.Traffickers prey upon the most vulnerable members of our society.They exploit and control their victims, often through force, violence, or abuse.And victims experience unimaginable harm, trauma, and stigma – all of which can prevent them from receiving the support they need and deserve.The Department of Justice is committed to combatting human trafficking from every angle, and to vindicating the rights of victims and survivors.We are committed to expanding our capacity to prevent human trafficking, including by working with federal, state, local, Tribal, and territorial law enforcement partners.We are committed to expanding our capacity to prosecute perpetrators of human trafficking crimes across all 94 of our U.S. Attorneys’ Offices.Prosecutors in our Civil Rights Division’s Human Trafficking Prosecution Unit work closely with AUSAs and law enforcement agencies to streamline investigations, ensure consistent application of trafficking statutes, and identify multijurisdictional trafficking networks. In addition, in June 2021, I established Joint Task Force Alpha in partnership with the Department of Homeland Security. The Task Force’s mission is to work within the United States and with our foreign partners in the Northern Triangle and Mexico to dismantle the most dangerous human smuggling and human trafficking networks. The Criminal Division’s Human Rights and Special Prosecutions Section helps lead and has numerous federal prosecutors assigned to the  Task Force. We also are committed to providing protection and trauma-informed assistance to victims and survivors of human trafficking.For two decades, the Department’s Office for Victims of Crime has led our efforts to protect and support survivors.In that time, this work has greatly expanded. In 2003, we issued almost $10 million in grants to combat human trafficking. By 2022, we issued more than $90 million. And that figure will grow even more in the year ahead, with up to $95 million in awards available. I am proud that the funding OVC manages is the largest amount of federal funding dedicated to supporting survivors of human trafficking.This funding is used to support direct services for survivors, including housing, employment, and legal assistance. It also supports multidisciplinary task forces, state-level capacity building, and a range of training and technical assistance – all aimed at combatting human trafficking.Together, these resources help ensure the safety and wellbeing of survivors. These resources empower survivors to help bring their traffickers to justice, including through testimony and victim-impact statements.   And these resources help prevent future crimes. I am grateful to OVC – and to everyone involved in this work – for how much you have done to advance our anti-trafficking efforts thus far. But I am grateful more for how much you will continue to do in the years ahead. Your work has made a real difference in the lives of survivors across the country, and it will continue to do so year in and year out. Building an effective response to human trafficking takes commitment and collaboration at every level of government and beyond. It demands a multi-disciplinary approach, and partnerships between subject-matter experts, law enforcement, and stakeholders. And most important, it requires listening to victims and survivors and incorporating their perspectives into everything that we do. Nearly one year ago, I announced the Department’s National Strategy to Combat Human Trafficking.This multi-year framework harnesses our law enforcement, prosecution, and grant-making capabilities to more effectively dismantling trafficking threats. The result is an approach to combating trafficking that puts victims first.And in the last year, we have put these policies into place.In support of the Strategy, we have released an updated version of the Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance. This version incorporates enhanced protections and addresses specific considerations for vulnerable victims and members of marginalized communities. We have developed and disseminated expanded training resources for federal prosecutors, to offer strategies for enforcing restitution and forfeiture provisions for human trafficking victims.We have expanded the scope of our Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Human Trafficking, so that this program now covers both emergency and transitional housing.And we have launched an interagency Forced Labor Initiative to enhance the detection, investigation, and prosecution of federal criminal forced labor crimes. This initiative is led by a committee of experts from the FBI, the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, and the Departments of Labor and Homeland Security.As I said, these are great strides forward. But there is much more to do. So, as we celebrate our accomplishments over the last 20 years, we will also recommit ourselves to doing this important work.We will continue to bring the full force of the Department to the fight against human trafficking. We will continue to bring traffickers to justice. We will continue to disrupt and dismantle the networks that enable these crimes. And we will continue to show victims, by word and by deed, that we are worthy of their trust.I’m now pleased to turn the podium back over to Kris.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 5 Good morning! I am delighted to be with you all in New Orleans, the traditional and sacred homeland of the Chitimacha, Choctaw, Houma, and Biloxi peoples.I believe it is crucial that we acknowledge the original, rightful and continuing stewards of this land. However, that acknowledgment means little if not accompanied by action following the leadership of Tribal advocates and survivors.That is why it is so important for OVW to be here: to be guided by the voices of all who are here in this room today.Our work is driven by the principle that we cannot end violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women without centering Tribal sovereignty. And all OVW’s work – not just our Tribal Affairs Division but all our grants and policies – are only effective when they are informed by Tribal leaders and designees.In that vein, under the Violence Against Women Act – or VAWA – the Department of Justice, in coordination with the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services, holds an annual government-to-government consultation with Tribal leaders on responding to violence against American Indian and Alaska Native women. OVW is honored to plan and host the consultation, which we held in Alaska for the first time ever last year.Every year at consultation, we hear powerful and sometimes heartbreaking testimony from Tribal leaders and designees who are living through the unbearable devastation of losing a loved one – of not knowing if someone missing will ever return.We cannot underestimate the role that sex trafficking has in these cases. Years ago, the Minnesota Indian Women’s Sexual Assault Coalition (MIWSAC) was the first to tell me about the shocking rates of sex trafficking in Indian Country: MIWSAC told me that girls were being recruited or even abducted while waiting for the bus. MIWSAC is still leading the way in documenting the problem and identifying strategies to stop it.This year, we conducted site visits in Alaska, and we heard that Alaska Native youth who leave home for Anchorage are approached by traffickers within days of arriving. We heard about Alaska Native youth in foster care in Ketchikan who had been trafficked, though they wouldn’t have defined themselves as victims and needed culturally specific responses that met them where they were. And we heard about the role of fishing fleets and extractive industries in exacerbating sex trafficking.Tribes need tools to address this.Last year, VAWA was reauthorized and restored Tribes’ inherent sovereign jurisdiction to Tribes to prosecute non-Indian perpetrators of sex trafficking, among other offenses – including sexual violence and child abuse in the context of domestic violence – committed on Tribal lands.The law also expands this jurisdiction to Alaska Native villages, who were left out of the previous legal framework. These victories for Tribal sovereignty are thanks to the determined advocacy of so many represented at this conference.If you have ever doubted that your voice counts in Washington, just look at VAWA. People said it couldn’t be done but you made it happen.And you worked for these historic wins because you are in community with those who are directly impacted. You yourselves are impacted. You are supporting survivors every day, and COVID-19 introduced an entirely new set of shifting circumstances for you to overcome.So, I want to thank you not only for your work on VAWA 2022, but for being here today, and my special thanks to Nicole Matthews and everyone at MIWSAC, Men as Peacemakers, the Tribal Law and Policy Institute and Mending the Sacred Hoop for bringing us together for this incredibly important conference.Addressing the disproportionately high rates of violence experienced by Indigenous people, including sexual violence and sex trafficking and relatedly, the high rates of Indigenous people who are missing, is a priority not just for OVW but for the entire Department of Justice.The missing and murdered Indigenous persons – or MMIP – crisis requires trauma-informed, victim-centered responses from across the Department of Justice.Last year, the Department launched an MMIP page with helpful resources for survivors and their loved ones, Tribal communities, law enforcement agencies and officers, and service providers. That can be found at justice.gov/Tribal/mmip.But we know we have much more to do, and we are guided in that work by the words of Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, in her directive creating a Justice Department Steering Committee to address the MMIP crisis, “The Department recognizes that challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions, and the Steering Committee should therefore make Tribal engagement the cornerstone of its work.” I want to reiterate, “the challenges faced by Tribes are best met by Tribal solutions.”I serve on the Not Invisible Act Commission, and I am proud to see those Tribal solutions at the heart of the commission’s work.But of course, those Tribal solutions need funding to succeed, and we want to support you. We want to invest in you and help you succeed once you get those federal funds. We are posting new grant solicitations – some are already online now – and I must encourage you to apply. Most of our grants prioritize Tribal organizations or Tribal governments in some way, so please look at all our available solicitations and not just the ones specific to Tribes. Information on our grants, purpose areas, and how to apply can all be found on our website, and we’ve brought informational material for you to take.I’ve been an applicant and a grantee myself, so I know it’s not as easy as just saying “apply!” We are working hard to make applications simpler, and our Tribal Affairs Division has done great work to revise and streamline applications – particularly for our grants to support Tribes in implementing that newly broadened special Tribal criminal jurisdiction.Another opportunity to build your own capacity and help OVW fund more Tribal organizations is to be a peer reviewer of grant applications. The peer review process involves active professionals from the field assessing applications against the criteria in the solicitation and selecting the best in the pool. When you serve as a peer reviewer, you get a behind-the-scenes look at how to be a successful applicant.You also bring your unique expertise. You help ensure that applications from Tribes and Tribal organizations are being reviewed by people who understand those communities, by people from those very communities, by people who know what culturally specific services look like. You can visit OVW’s website for more information and fill out the recruitment form to submit via email.I want to close by thanking the survivors in the audience. To everyone who has struggled and is here today to turn that pain into action: we see you. We stand with you. We will fight side by side with you. We are going to change the world together.Thank you.</span>

And today’s landmark action against Google underscores that it is a priority of this Justice Department to fight the abuse of market power. We know that free and fair competition is essential to economic freedom. And we know that anticompetitive conduct threatens innovation, weakens workers’ rights, and stifles free expression. When any company, including a big technology company, violates the antitrust laws, our economy and our democracy suffer. Today’s complaint is a perfect example of why competition matters. Americans rely on the internet for news and for community. And advertising revenue is essential for publishers to produce and share ideas and writings. But we allege that Google has captured that revenue for its own profits and punished publishers who sought out alternatives. Those actions have weakened the free and open internet and increased advertising costs for businesses and for the United States government, including for our military.   Today’s complaint is also just one example of the department’s broader efforts to root out anticompetitive behavior regardless of how and where it might arise. Just a few months ago, the Antitrust Division scored a critical win for authors by blocking a merger of two major publishing houses, Penguin Random House and Simon &amp;amp; Schuster. The merger would have substantially lessened authors’ compensation for their work and diminished opportunities for new authors to tell new stories. That merger was one of five that have been blocked or abandoned as a result of the division’s recent work; other abandoned mergers include two that would have strained the global supply chain by decreasing competition for shipping materials. And the Penguin Random House case is just one example of the department’s efforts to protect workers. This past summer, we secured an $85 million payment from poultry companies to settle allegations that they fixed workers’ wages and benefits.We have also reinvigorated criminal enforcement of the Sherman Act, including prosecutions for criminal wage-fixing, labor-market allocation, bid-rigging, and procurement fraud. And we have acted to ensure that corporate directors do not sit on competing boards, reviving a vital and underenforced rule of antitrust law.These efforts by the Antitrust Division are only a snapshot of the broader work happening across the department to advance economic justice, protect workers’ rights and ensure fair prices for products we use and rely on, like health insurance, airline tickets and food for our families. Today’s suit against Google exemplifies that we will continue to marshal our resources across divisions to promote competition and protect American workers and consumers.I’ll now turn it over to Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who will speak more about the details of our complaint.</span>
