Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the "Wordly" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section. The IACP and IMPACT Section annual memberships allow members access to IACP policies, to network, and to gain from emailed policing information including webinars, good practices, and Quarterly IACP IMPACT Section international police Zoom meetings and presentations. Several ICITAP employees and contractors hold key positions in the leadership of the IACP and IACP IMPACT Section, which greatly enhances international police opportunities for all attendees hosted through ICITAP.</span>

Conversatorios are conversations between the judicial actors, including judges, prosecutors, defense and / or any other pertinent parties such as forensics experts, child advocates, etc. The goal is the creation of a space for honest dialogue to address and solve issues or problems that may arise in the administration and practice of justice in the state. This session was a first for the state of Guanajuato. Among those present were the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and Counselor of the Judicial Branch of the State of Guanajuato, and the Attorney General of the State. The Director of the ICITAP CCT Program welcomed the participants, which included approximately 63 public servants, including judges, magistrates, directors and heads of specialized units of Guanajuato’s Judicial Branch and Attorney General's Office, who actively participated in the sessions and discussions. Several public servants expressed their satisfaction with the quality and relevance of the topics addressed, as well as the practical usefulness. Four main topics were addressed at this first Guanajuato session. The first discussion highlighted the importance of presenting solid evidence at the initial appearance as a basis to link the suspect to the case and the need to standardize criteria between judges and prosecutors, which guarantees impartial and effective justice. The second topic was one that will likely affect the entire Mexican system based on a recent ruling by Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the importance of an exhaustive analysis of the data to justify preventive detention, promoting a consistent application of this measure for the benefit of public safety. Next, they discussed the effectiveness of the abbreviated procedure (plea agreement) mechanism to speed up judicial processes, with the commitment of the judiciary and the prosecutor's office to promote its use under the correct circumstances. Lastly, the coordinator for the Women’s Center for Justice discussed a proposal to create a specialized court for family violence and generated consensus on its importance to improve the protection of women and children, a crucial step towards a more inclusive and equitable justice system. This first meeting in Guanajuato between justice actors for the continuous improvement of the criminal justice system reaffirmed the importance of these spaces for discussion and mutual learning. The active participation of the attendees and the constant exchange of ideas is evidence that these forums guide necessary change in the evolution of efficiency, transparency, and practice of the justice system.

Training Session:  \n      Fiscal Year 2011 Agency Annual FOIA Reports and \n      2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports \n   \n      On  October 13, 2011, the Office of Information Policy (OIP) will host a refresher  training session to go over the reporting requirements for Fiscal Year 2011  Annual FOIA Reports and 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&amp;nbsp; Both reports must be submitted to OIP for  clearance prior to final posting.&amp;nbsp; At the  training session the requirements for both reports will be reviewed and there  will be time for questions.&amp;nbsp; The Annual  FOIA Report covers Fiscal Year 2011, while the 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Report  will cover agency activities from March 2011 to March 2012.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; \n      Fiscal Year 2011 Annual  FOIA Reports\n       Last year OIP provided agencies with  an Excel tool to be used in creating their Annual FOIA Reports.&amp;nbsp; OIP will soon provide agencies with an  updated tool to create their Fiscal Year 2011 Annual FOIA Reports.&amp;nbsp; Prior to the training, OIP will send agencies  a link along with instructions which will allow them to download the updated  tool.&amp;nbsp; \n      The tool will generate the Annual FOIA Report in  an open format, which is required by the Open Government Directive and will allow uploading of the data into FOIA.GOV.&amp;nbsp; As was done in Fiscal Year 2010, agencies  must also publish their 2011 Annual FOIA Report in the PDF or similar  human-readable format traditionally used for publishing Annual FOIA  Reports.&amp;nbsp; \n      Agency Annual FOIA Reports in both  their open and human-readable formats should be submitted to OIP electronically  at DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov no later than December  5, 2011, in order to allow sufficient time for OIP to review them prior to  posting.\n      After the reports are reviewed and  cleared by OIP, they should be posted on each agency’s website in both open  format and in the PDF or similar human-readable format.&amp;nbsp;\n  2012 Chief FOIA Officer  Reports\n        On March 19, 2009, the Attorney General directed agency Chief  FOIA Officers to review “all aspects of their agencies’ FOIA administration”  and to report each year to the Department of Justice on the steps taken “to  improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their  agencies.”&amp;nbsp;\n      OIP will be issuing new reporting requirements  for the 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports, and prior to the meeting will post  these requirements on OIP’s Guidance page.&amp;nbsp; The Chief FOIA Officer Reports should be  submitted to OIP electronically at DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov in either PDF or similar human-readable  format no later than February 1, 2012, to enable OIP to review and clear the

                                                                        Notifying Requesters of the Mediation Services Offered by OGIS\n\nAs part of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, the FOIA was amended to create the Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) within the National Archives and Records Administration.&amp;nbsp; OGIS opened in September 2009 and the Department of Justice provided agencies with details about this new office in FOIA Post.\n\nA significant new feature of FOIA administration is the offering of mediation services by OGIS to resolve disputes between requesters and agencies, as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.&amp;nbsp; All agencies share the Department of Justice's goal to prevent disputes in the first instance.&amp;nbsp; To the extent that disputes arise, however, mediation holds potential to resolve those disputes short of litigation.&amp;nbsp; OGIS offers mediation services for just that purpose.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\n\nMediation is a voluntary process where a mediator assists the parties in resolving their dispute.&amp;nbsp; The mediator is a third-party neutral with no authority to make a decision.&amp;nbsp; The value of mediation is that the parties themselves, with the help of the mediator, devise an agreement to resolve their dispute.&amp;nbsp; In the context of the FOIA, mediation is now offered by OGIS as a non-exclusive alternative to litigation.&amp;nbsp; OGIS reports that both FOIA requesters and agencies have asked for its assistance and that OGIS has facilitated the resolution of a number of disputes, short of formal mediation, over the past few months.&amp;nbsp; The OGIS case log and information about those cases are available on the OGIS website.\n\nIn order to ensure that all requesters know of this service, agencies should include in their final agency responses to requesters a standard paragraph notifying the requester that mediation services are offered by OGIS and giving contact information for that office.&amp;nbsp; This notification to requesters should be provided at the conclusion of the administrative process within the agency, i.e., as part of the agency's final response on administrative appeal.&amp;nbsp; This will allow requesters to first exhaust their administrative remedies within the agency.&amp;nbsp; Agencies should also, of course, continue to provide requesters with notification of their right to seek judicial review.&amp;nbsp; OGIS offers language that agencies might wish to use as a model for notifying requesters of its services.\n\nResolving FOIA disputes through mediation holds the potential to reduce litigation, thereby saving time and money for agencies and requesters alike, as well as enhancing the operation of the FOIA and public collaboration.\n</span>

           Annual FOIA Report Q &amp;amp; As\n\nQ: When one component of an agency receives a consultation sent from another component of the same agency, should the receiving component count that incoming consultation in Section XII of the Annual FOIA Report?\n\nYes. Section XII of the Annual FOIA Report requires agencies, and agency components, to report information about consultations that they have received from other agencies as well as those received from other components within their own agency.\n\nAgencies and agency components should be careful to report only consultations received from other agencies or from other components of their agency, and to not include consultations that they have sent to other agencies and/or components.\n\nQ: When an agency receives, processes and responds to a FOIA request all on the same day, how should the agency report the response time for that request in the Annual FOIA Report?\n\nWhen an agency FOIA office receives a request directly from the requester and it is the proper FOIA office to have received the request, if that office processes and responds to the request within that same day, the agency should report this response time as "\n\nStarting with requests received December 31, 2008, this rule will likewise apply when a FOIA office receives a misdirected request from another FOIA office in its agency which had routed it to the proper office on or before the tenth day from the original date of receipt. See FOIA Post, "New Requirement to Route Misdirected FOIA Requests" (posted 11/18/2008). In other words, when the proper FOIA office receives, processes and responds to a request on the same day and that day is the tenth day, or earlier, of the routing period, the proper FOIA office should report the response time for that request as "\n\nThis rule, on the other hand, will not apply if a FOIA office receives a misdirected request from another FOIA office in its agency if the proper office receives the request later than ten days from the original date of receipt. In this instance, the proper FOIA office must count the tenth day of the routing period as the beginning of the twenty-day response period and count forward accordingly to determine its response time for that request. Therefore, if, for example, the proper FOIA office receives the routed request on the eleventh day (rather than on or before the tenth day of the routing period) that day constitutes "day 1" of the twenty-day response period. In this example, if the proper FOIA office processed and responded to that request on the same day it received the request from the receiving FOIA office, it would report its response time as one day, not less than one day.\n\nQ: How should agencies account for requests which have been remanded following administrative appeal?\n\nIt is important that agencies keep track of the time spent on any request that is remanded for further processing after administrative appeal. In order to track a remanded request and capture the time taken to process it, agencies may give the remanded request a new number, or annotate the original tracking number to reflect that it has been remanded. The time spent processing a remanded request should then be included in the agency's Annual FOIA Report, just as is done for all other FOIA requests.\n</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 4 Since 1991, OPDAT has provided expert assistance and case-based mentoring to foreign counterparts to develop justice systems that can combat transnational crime, corruption, and terrorism consistent with international standards (e.g., the UN Convention against Corruption). In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of related crime throughout the world, OPDAT provides foreign counterparts with tailored assistance and case-based mentoring – within the scope of its authorized activities – to help detect, investigate and prosecute wrongdoing related to the pandemic. Specifically, OPDAT helps counterparts combat:\n\n\n\tcybercrime, cyber-enabled crime (e.g., online fraud) and intellectual property crime;\n\tpublic-procurement corruption;\n\tgender-based / domestic violence; and\n\tthe spread of COVID-19.\n\n\nOPDAT also:\n\n\n\tsupports the rule of law generally during the pandemic.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nIn carrying out this assistance and case-based mentoring, OPDAT relies on its unique access to some of the most experienced criminal justice experts in the nation: the Department of Justice’s over 5,000 Assistant U.S. Attorneys and 600 Criminal Division attorneys. These experts include COVID – 19 Coordinators for their respective U.S. Attorneys Offices, as well as attorneys from the Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (CCIPS). They share with foreign counterparts their experiences in combatting COVID-19 related crime, including fraud and corruption and cyber-enabled and intellectual property crime. OPDAT’s programs are funded through interagency agree­ments between OPDAT and U.S. Government partners, primarily the U.S. Department of State.\n\n(1) Combatting cybercrime, cyber-enabled crime and intellectual property crime:\n\nThe U.S. Transnational and High-Tech Crime Global Law Enforcement Network (GLEN) program is the result of a partnership between the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement Affairs (DOS/INL) and the U.S. Department of Justice’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section (DOJ/CCIPS) and Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (DOJ/OPDAT).\n\nThe GLEN is a global law enforcement capacity-building network of International Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property (ICHIP) prosecutors, computer forensic analysts, and federal law enforcement agents focused on delivering training and technical assistance to foreign law enforcement partners to combat intellectual property and cybercrime activity, as well as to assist in the collection and use of electronic evidence to combat all types of crime, including transnational organized crime (TOC).\n\nCurrently, ICHIPs are posted to regional positions in Africa (Abuja, Nigeria), Asia (Hong Kong S.A.R. and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia), Europe (Bucharest, Romania, and the Hague), and Western Hemisphere (Sao Paulo, Brazil). Two subject-matter expert ICHIPs -- the ICHIP for Internet Fraud and Public Health (IFPH) and the ICHIP for Dark Web and Cryptocurrency (DWC) -- as well as DOJ computer forensic analysts and law enforcement officials with intellectual property and cybercrime expertise also form part of the GLEN.&amp;nbsp; Later this year, ICHIPs also will be posted to Panama City, Panama; Zagreb, Croatia; and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

The OPDAT RLA presented on criminal fraud trends during the COVID-19 crisis, including healthcare and consumer fraud, financial fraud, and cyber-enabled scams.&amp;nbsp; U.S. Embassy Sofia highlighted the webinar on its website and on social media:\n\thttps://bg.usembassy.gov/webinar-with-u-s-embassy-sofia-resident-legal-advisor-jessica-kim/\n\thttps://www.facebook.com/USEmbassySofia/posts/3063555520366604\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tSerbia: On April 29, OPDAT co-hosted the first in a series of virtual case-based mentoring roundtables for Serbian prosecutors.&amp;nbsp; The roundtable helped to share best practices and raise awareness of proactive steps the U.S. Department of Justice is taking to protect individuals and businesses from COVID-related crimes, including procurement fraud, bribery, and other forms of corruption.&amp;nbsp; The appointment of COVID-19 fraud coordinators at prosecutors’ offices, the creation of e-hotlines for the public to report suspect frauds and corruption, and the formation of multi-agency COVID-crimes task forces are proactive measures that can help keep the public safe, in the United States and abroad.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tBosnia and Herzegovina: OPDAT is providing case-based mentoring to Bosnian counterparts on several significant investigations that involve fraud in procurement of medical equipment during COVID-19.&amp;nbsp; OPDAT has also convened four virtual roundtables for Bosnian prosecutors and public procurement officials to build coordination on the detection, investigation, and prosecution of fraud in emergency procurement during COVID-19. The virtual roundtables also helped raise awareness&amp;nbsp;on other abuses that&amp;nbsp;are taking place during the pandemic; they include illegal hiring in public institutions and donation of humanitarian funds with the intent to influence upcoming elections.&amp;nbsp; Local prosecutors and officials note that OPDAT’s programs have helped raise awareness about abuses during COVID-19 and have resulted in multiple referrals of cases involving corruption in public procurement to prosecutors’ offices. The Tuzla Canton Prosecutor’s Office published a video on its YouTube page in which the office recognized U.S. assistance in establishing such cooperation within the government.&amp;nbsp;\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n(3) Combatting gender-based / domestic violence: \n\n\n\tAlbania and Kosovo:&amp;nbsp; On May 6, OPDAT convened a regional meeting of victim advocates from Albania and Kosovo to discuss the challenge of responding to domestic violence crimes during the pandemic. OPDAT led discussions on the role of the victim advocate during the criminal justice process, techniques for promoting cooperation between prosecutors and victim advocates, lessons learned from the first two months of supporting survivors while under pandemic-related movement restrictions, and the development of best practices for providing protection and support to victims while under such restrictions.&amp;nbsp; OPDAT facilitated the creation of victim advocate programs in both Albania and Kosovo, which serve as models for the region.&amp;nbsp; Consequently, the techniques developed by these institutions to counter the rise in domestic violence cases will be instructive for counterparts across the Balkans.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tBosnia and Herzegovina: On April 22, OPDAT co-sponsored with the Atlantic Initiative, a roundtable of prosecutors, judges, and NGO representatives throughout Bosnia to discuss the justice system’s response to domestic violence crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has forced many victims to shelter in place with their abusers. &amp;nbsp;\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tAlbania: OPDAT has provided support to Albania’s Victim Coordinators, whose positions OPDAT helped to establish in partnership with Albania’s Prosecutor General’s Office, to continue helping victims of violent crime, including domestic and sexual violence, during the COVID-19 Pandemic.&amp;nbsp;These Victim Coordinators are able to work remotely, thanks to laptops, which were donated through OPDAT prior to the onset of the pandemic.&amp;nbsp;\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tKosovo: OPDAT has provided support for victims advocates and helpline providers who are assisting victims on domestic violence in Kosovo and experiencing increased danger from the COVID-19 movement restrictions. Through virtual instruction and consultations, OPDAT has provided guidance to victims advocates on developing safety plans with victims, presenting compelling evidence in domestic violence cases, and facilitating the use of risk assessment tools by judges when considering protection orders.&amp;nbsp; OPDAT also supported the work of Kosovo’s emergency helpline providers by providing virtual training on counseling victims over the phone during the crisis.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n(4) Helping to combat the spread of COVID-19:\n\n\n\tAfrica: OPDAT has been tracking its African counterparts’ COVID-19 remediation efforts in their prison populations. In Ethiopia alone, according to the U.S. Embassy, over 44,000 prisoners have been ordered released. OPDAT’s tracking has helped spur discussion among African counterparts and others on how to advocate for early release and to approach excessive pre-trial detention and related priorities during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. In Cameroon, OPDAT has advised the Ministry of Justice, which supervises the prisons, regarding the dangers of COVID-19 in Cameroon’s prisons. On April 15, Cameroon’s President issued a decree commuting the sentences of numerous prisoners. According to the U.S. Embassy, over 3,000 convicted inmates have been released. In coordination with the CDC, OPDAT continues to advise the Ministry of Justice on reducing the pre-trial population and mitigating the risk of transmission by releasing inmates. In Mali, on April 14, OPDAT assisted the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children and UNODC in hosting a French-language online webinar, including a discussion on the impact of the global coronavirus pandemic on the vulnerability of children.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tBurma: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, OPDAT drafted a series of detailed recommendations to assist the Burmese Government in preventing an explosion of COVID-19 cases in its overcrowded prison system, including reducing the prison population and introducing better practices to counter infectious diseases inside prisons. As part of the annual amnesty marking Thingyan, Burma’s Buddhist New Year, the Government announced that it was releasing 24,896 prisoners (of the entire 92,000 prison population).\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tQatar: In Qatar, an OPDAT alumnus was appointed to head the country’s newly created Health Prosecutions Office, which enforces measures taken by the Government of Qatar to contain the spread of COVID-19.&amp;nbsp;The prosecutor previously had participated in the first U.S.-Qatar Prosecutor Exchange Program, an OPDAT program that familiarizes Qatar prosecutors with the U.S. justice sector.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n\n(5) Supporting the rule of law during the pandemic:\n\n\n\tKosovo:&amp;nbsp; On June 3, OPDAT held a virtual workshop for Kosovo and U.S. judges to exchange best practices on virtual hearings and the use of technology to ensure judicial efficiency during the COVID-19 pandemic.&amp;nbsp; The U.S. federal judges discussed best practices for remote judicial review of search and arrest warrants, virtual detention hearings, case prioritization, ensuring procedural rights during virtual proceedings, and virtual sentencing hearings.&amp;nbsp; This judicial exchange allowed Kosovo judges to learn how to overcome challenges and disruptions caused by the pandemic.&amp;nbsp; It also enabled the judges to explore and identify creative ways to move forward with hearings while adhering to social distancing requirements.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tMalaysia:&amp;nbsp; On May 27, OPDAT hosted a webinar for 84 Malaysian counterparts on strategies on terrorism trials and courthouse procedures during the COVID-19 pandemic.&amp;nbsp; OPDAT moderated the webinar, which included Chief Justice of Malaysia Tengku Maimun binti Tuan Mat, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers.&amp;nbsp; Chargé D’Affaires Dean Thompson delivered opening remarks, and Justice Department DAAG Bruce Swartz provided closing remarks.&amp;nbsp; In between, a U.S. federal judge discussed the three phases that he has designed to resume operations in his court and shared photos of clear plastic screens he has placed around his courtroom to protect staff and the public.&amp;nbsp; The Malaysian judges expressed great interest in learning more about the three-phase protocol implemented by the U.S. federal judge.&amp;nbsp; Chief Justice Tengku Maimun thanked OPDAT and Embassy Malaysia for hosting the webinar.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tNorth Macedonia:&amp;nbsp; On May 12, OPDAT brought together three U.S. federal judges and more than 40 judges and judicial officials from North Macedonia for an exchange on virtual court management.&amp;nbsp; U.S. Ambassador to North Macedonia Kate Marie Byrnes opened the event and discussed the importance of adapting judicial practices.&amp;nbsp; Following presentations by the U.S. federal judges, OPDAT facilitated a discussion about ways judges could conduct pre-trial procedures and hearings virtually.&amp;nbsp; The North Macedonia judges asked questions of the U.S. judges about ensuring the defendant’s right to counsel during virtual hearings, maintaining confidentiality in signing pre-trial warrants, and how different technological platforms are used in practice.&amp;nbsp; The judges agreed that even when pandemic restrictions loosen, the judiciary must be prepared for the continued use of technology in the management of criminal cases.&amp;nbsp; The event was publicized on the U.S. Embassy’s Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/USEmbassySkopje/posts/10157216679872157\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tBulgaria:&amp;nbsp; The U.S. Embassy Resident Legal Advisor held a virtual roundtable on April 22 with representatives of Bulgarian civil society organizations. This is part of an ongoing series of roundtables that the Embassy holds with civil society representatives.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tThe judiciary: From April 21-23, OPDAT’s Judicial Studies Institute held three virtual roundtables with alumni to discuss the challenges for courts of ensuring access to justice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Forty-nine judges from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panamá, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru participated. The judges shared their experiences and discussed how different countries’ judiciary are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tRomania:&amp;nbsp; On April 15, the U.S. Resident Legal Advisor hosted a virtual roundtable with representatives of Romanian civil society organizations on preserving the rule of law during the COVID-19 pandemic.&amp;nbsp; The discussion centered on the implications of emergency measures on the rule of law, including access to justice, health and information.&amp;nbsp; Participants also discussed government transparency and accountability and the pandemic’s impact on independent media and minority communities.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tPhilippines: On April 14, OPDAT and CCIPS led a virtual roundtable for Philippine prosecutors on the implementation of “E-Inquest.” The newly launched electronic platform is for conducting virtual criminal proceedings in cases of warrantless arrests. OPDAT and CCIPS helped troubleshoot some problems associated with the rollout to ensure the continued use of “E-Inquest.” The workshop is now sought after by other Philippine justice sector partners who seek to employ similar means to carry out their mission amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Metro Manila and other cities in the Philippines are locked down with all courts closed for in-person hearings. The Philippine Supreme Court issued a directive for courts to use video conference court hearings for urgent criminal matters involving detainees. In response, OPDAT and CCIPS immediately hosted an online roundtable for a Cebu City Regional Trial Court judge, his staff, the city jail warden, and representatives from the prosecution and public defender’s office. Due to growing demand, ODPAT and CCIPS will provide future roundtables for other courts.&amp;nbsp;\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tEl Salvador: El Salvadorian police have struggled to properly enforce the country’s quarantine law.&amp;nbsp; OPDAT helped develop guidelines, which&amp;nbsp;can be used by police to help them properly and fairly enforce the law.&amp;nbsp;Separately, an OPDAT-mentored judge and alumnus of OPDAT’s Judicial Studies Institute inspected the conditions at a COVID-19 quarantine facility. Through its working relationship with judges in El Salvador, OPDAT has helped the country maintain the rule of law in the face of COVID-19 exigencies.\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\tKosovo: OPDAT has provided extensive consultations with the Kosovo Judicial Council and Kosovo Prosecutorial Council on developing policy measures which will allow the justice system to continue essential operations and protect the rule of law during the pandemic.&amp;nbsp; This assistance has resulted in the assignment of on-call judges and administrative staff, permitting electronic filings, tolling of statutory limitations when permitted by law, and the development of an action plan on how to deal with cases approaching the end of their statute of limitation.&amp;nbsp;\n\t&amp;nbsp;\n\n</span>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Segregating and Marking Documents for Release in Accordance with the OPEN Government Act\n\nSection 12 of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, amended Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which contains the requirement that agencies provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information contained in documents that are responsive to FOIA requests. Since the 1996 amendments to the FOIA, agencies have been required to indicate the amount of information deleted on the released portion of the record, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. See Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-231, § 4, 110 Stat. 3048-49 (concluding sentences); see also FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 1, at 6 ("Amendment Implementation Questions"); FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 2, at 2 ("FOIA Counselor: Questions &amp;amp; Answers"). Moreover, the FOIA provides that if technically feasible, the amount of the withheld information should be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion is made.\n\nThe OPEN Government Act added one additional requirement to this provision regarding the duty to segregate documents for release. Specifically, Section 12 of the OPEN Government Act provides that when marking documents to indicate the amount of information deleted, and the location of that deletion, agencies should also indicate the exemption being asserted. This straightforward requirement codifies what has been an existing practice for many agencies and follows the approach long recommended by the Office of Information and Privacy (OIP).\n\nAmended Segregation Provision\n\nSection (b) of the FOIA, which contains the FOIA's nine statutory exemptions, also directs agencies to release to FOIA requesters any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information that is contained in those records. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (sentence immediately following exemptions). As amended by the OPEN Government Act, the provision now reads:\n\n\nAny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated on the released portion of the record unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (amended language in italics).\n\n\nThe requirement to provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the records that are responsive to FOIA requests is a fundamental tenant of the Act. Indeed, courts have long focused on this requirement. See, e.g., Department of Justice Freedom of Information Act Guide (Mar. 2007), at 113-19 ("Reasonably Segregable" Obligation) (collecting cases); id. at 1005-10 ("Reasonably Segregable" Requirements) (likewise collecting cases). Thus, it is important that agencies remain mindful of the need to reasonably segregate and release any non-exempt information whenever they are processing a FOIA request. See, e.g., Stolt-Neilsen Transp. Group Ltd. v. United States, 534 F.3d 728, 734 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (concluding that the district court has an affirmative duty to consider reasonable segregability even if the requester never raised the issue).\n\nThe remaining elements of the segregation provision, including the new statutory amendment, address how documents should be marked once it is determined that they contain reasonably segregable, non-exempt information. First, the amount of information that is being withheld, and now also the exemption under which the withholding is being made, should be indicated on the released portion of the record itself. The FOIA has long contained an exception to this requirement for those instances where revealing the amount and location of the information being redacted would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. This exception now also includes the situation where revealing the exemption itself on the face of the released-in-part document would harm an interest protected by the exemption. In such rare circumstances, the agency need not mark the released portion of the document in such a way that by doing so would cause harm to an interest protected by the exemption being asserted.\n\nFor example, if a portion of an otherwise releaseable document is being protected under Exemption 7(A) to prevent interference with an on-going law enforcement investigation, and if the agency determines that indicating the amount of information being deleted under that exemption, or now, that marking Exemption 7(A) on that portion of the document will, in context with the released portions of the record, interfere with the on-going investigation, then the agency need not include those markings on that particular record. Such situations will be rare, however, and any agency processing a request which raises questions as to whether the FOIA's marking provisions apply to a given document are encouraged to contact OIP.\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, the exception to the marking requirement is not applicable. As a result, the three marking requirements will ordinarily apply. Those requirements direct agencies to indicate the amount of information being withheld on the released portion of the record itself. As a result of the OPEN Government Act, agencies must now also mark the document to show the exemption under which the deletion is being made. The third marking requirement provides that agencies must, if technically feasible, place that indication as to the amount of information being deleted and the exemption being asserted, at the place in the record where the deletion occurs. Thus, a FOIA requester reviewing documents released in part would be able to see directly, in the context of the released portions of the document, how much material has been withheld, the exemption used to make the withholding, and where within the document the deletion occurred.\n\nMarking Documents for Release\n\nFor most records the marking requirements will be readily met by "blacking out" or otherwise physically marking through the protected information in the record and then inserting a notation regarding the exemption being asserted for that particular deletion. The volume of the withheld material will be apparent from the "blacked out" portions, as will the location within the document where the excision occurs.\n\nIn light of this, it is important that agencies do not "white out" information when withholding it under the FOIA, as that can make it difficult for a requester to identify the amount of withheld material and its location within a document. Instead, agencies must mark documents in a way that makes it readily apparent to the requester where within a document information has been withheld. This can be accomplished by darkening, or "blacking out" the withheld portions of the documents, or by inserting brackets around them, or by outlining or "boxing" them, or any other method that ensures that a requester can easily discern where the redactions have been made. Further, each page containing redactions should be marked to show the amount of information being withheld and the exemption being asserted and, if technically feasible, those markings should be placed at the point in the record where the deletion occurs.\n\nThe following examples demonstrate several possible approaches to marking documents so that the newly added requirement to specify the exemption being asserted is met. One of the clearest ways to do that is to insert a notation as to the exemption being asserted within the space that remains after the information has been excised.\n\n\n\nWhen a paragraph or group of paragraphs are withheld on a page, the exemption(s) used to protect the information in the paragraphs may similarly be noted within the marked-out space.\n\n\n\nYet another approach is to use an arrow to connect a particular redaction to the annotation indicating the applicable exemption(s), or to include the exemption notation at the end of the line where the excision occurs.\n\n\n\nThese examples are illustrative and are not intended to be exclusive. Agencies will likely employ a variety of techniques to mark documents depending on the nature of the documents at issue and the redaction capabilities of the agency. The key requirement for agencies when marking documents that will be released in part is to comply with the overall purpose of the segregation provision which is to readily reveal to a requester the amount of information being withheld in a document, its location within that document, and the exemption being asserted for that redaction.\n\nConclusion\n\nAgencies have long been required to segregate documents for release and to mark those documents to indicate the amount of information deleted and, ordinarily, the location of the deletion. The new statutory provisions of the OPEN Government Act simply add the next logical step to that requirement, mandating that the exemption being asserted in connection with a given deletion be indicated directly at the place of the deletion. The purpose of the amendment is to make it plain on the face of any record disclosed in part the agency's statutory basis for each discrete withholding contained within the document.\n</span>

   \nOpen Format Requirements for Agency Annual FOIA Reports\n\n\nFor the Fiscal Year 2011 Annual FOIA Reports, OIP will once again be providing agencies with an Excel tool to be used in creating their report.&amp;nbsp; This tool, which is very similar to the one that OIP distributed last year, has many features to assist agencies in compiling their data, including built-in math checks.&amp;nbsp; The tool will also generate the Annual FOIA Report in an open format, which is required by the Open Government Directive and is used to upload data onto FOIA.Gov.&amp;nbsp; OIP anticipates sending agencies a link which will allow agencies to download the updated tool prior to the refresher training on Annual FOIA Reports that will be held this Fall.&amp;nbsp; Agencies should also publish their 2011 Annual FOIA Report in the PDF or similar human-readable format traditionally used for publishing Annual FOIA Reports.\n\n\n</span>
