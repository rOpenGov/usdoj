The officers participating in the training are assigned to the SB’s Special Surveillance Unit and/or the newly established All-Female Counterterrorism Team. The training lasted three weeks in total and covered elements critical to physical surveillance operations, such as mission planning, foot and vehicle surveillance, threat recognition, among other topics. This training is the first of two iterations planned for SB in closing of 2024 activities. Via participation in this course, EMPoWER is seeking to strengthen SB’s female officer’s capacity to engage in operational assignments. EMPoWER continues to work with SB to increase the meaningful participation of women in counterterrorism law enforcement. In Jordan, ICITAP-EMPoWER is managed with the support of and in coordination with the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism.</span>

This training was designed to enhance the performance of Criminal Investigators, strengthen the skills, expertise, and values necessary to resolve cases through the discovery, identification, assessment, collection, preservation, and presentation of material evidence (EMP), physical evidence, and legally obtained information, within criminal processes under current legislation and best professional practices. The objectives of the course were: 1) Utilize the fundamentals of the role as a criminal investigator to address professional situations; 2) Decide whether to initiate a criminal investigation based on a presented situation; 3) Plan criminal investigations using the "Strategic Criminal Investigation Planning" tool (PEIC). The 19 participants three females and sixteen males are assigned to the prioritized areas of the project investigating Homicides (11), Sexual Violence (5), Kidnapping and Extortion (2), and Environmental Crimes (1).</span>

Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the "Wordly" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section.

Conversatorios are conversations between the judicial actors, including judges, prosecutors, defense and / or any other pertinent parties such as forensics experts, child advocates, etc. The goal is the creation of a space for honest dialogue to address and solve issues or problems that may arise in the administration and practice of justice in the state. This session was a first for the state of Guanajuato. Among those present were the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and Counselor of the Judicial Branch of the State of Guanajuato, and the Attorney General of the State. The Director of the ICITAP CCT Program welcomed the participants, which included approximately 63 public servants, including judges, magistrates, directors and heads of specialized units of Guanajuato’s Judicial Branch and Attorney General's Office, who actively participated in the sessions and discussions. Several public servants expressed their satisfaction with the quality and relevance of the topics addressed, as well as the practical usefulness. Four main topics were addressed at this first Guanajuato session. The first discussion highlighted the importance of presenting solid evidence at the initial appearance as a basis to link the suspect to the case and the need to standardize criteria between judges and prosecutors, which guarantees impartial and effective justice. The second topic was one that will likely affect the entire Mexican system based on a recent ruling by Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the importance of an exhaustive analysis of the data to justify preventive detention, promoting a consistent application of this measure for the benefit of public safety. Next, they discussed the effectiveness of the abbreviated procedure (plea agreement) mechanism to speed up judicial processes, with the commitment of the judiciary and the prosecutor's office to promote its use under the correct circumstances. Lastly, the coordinator for the Women’s Center for Justice discussed a proposal to create a specialized court for family violence and generated consensus on its importance to improve the protection of women and children, a crucial step towards a more inclusive and equitable justice system. This first meeting in Guanajuato between justice actors for the continuous improvement of the criminal justice system reaffirmed the importance of these spaces for discussion and mutual learning. The active participation of the attendees and the constant exchange of ideas is evidence that these forums guide necessary change in the evolution of efficiency, transparency, and practice of the justice system. ICITAP is committed to continue recommending the implementation of these inter-agency discussions across Mexico. The first state to participate in this exercise was Tabasco and the next is scheduled in Baja California Sur.&amp;nbsp;</span>



                                                                                                             Presidential Statement and White House Memorandum on the FOIA Issued During Sunshine WeekOn March 16, 2010, during Sunshine Week, the White House issued both a Presidential Statement and a Memorandum on the FOIA.&amp;nbsp; First, President Obama issued a statement on the FOIA.&amp;nbsp; In his Statement, the President applauded the work that has been done so far to increase transparency.&amp;nbsp; He also recommitted his administration “to be the most open and transparent ever.”&amp;nbsp; After highlighting some of the transparency initiatives the White House has undertaken, the President concluded by stating that “our work is not done” and that “[w]e will continue to work toward an unmatched level of transparency, participation, and accountability across the entire Administration.”On that same day, Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff, and Bob Bauer, Counsel to the President, issued a Memorandum to the Heads of Departments and Agencies on the Freedom of Information Act.&amp;nbsp; The Memorandum highlights the successful work that has been done by agencies “to make the government more open and accountable to the American people.”&amp;nbsp; The White House also expressed appreciation to agencies for their efforts in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and confidence that agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports will demonstrate the progress achieved thus far.At the same time, the White House points out that “more work remains to be done, and such work requires persistent effort.”&amp;nbsp; The White House requests department and agency heads to take action in two specific areas “to ensure full implementation of the President's Memorandum on FOIA.”&amp;nbsp;First, agencies are instructed to update all their FOIA guidance and training materials “to include the principles articulated in the President's Memorandum.”&amp;nbsp; Second, the White House directs agencies to “assess whether [they] are devoting adequate resources to responding to FOIA requests promptly and cooperatively, consistent with the requirements for addressing this Presidential priority.”The Memorandum closes by noting that agencies may already be taking these and other steps as part of their drafting of their Open Government Plans, which are being developed as a result of the Open Government Directive.As these White House transmissions convey, agencies should be very proud of the work they have accomplished thus far in improving transparency.&amp;nbsp; Although there is more work to be done in the year ahead, a preliminary review of&amp;nbsp;agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports reveals that the key agencies across the government, which handle the bulk of the FOIA requests, have made real progress in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&amp;nbsp; Complete details about agency activities and progress will be forthcoming in OIP's report on its review and analysis of the Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&amp;nbsp; A summary containing highlights from those reports is available on our website.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 2 Guidelines for 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to the Department of JusticePursuant to Attorney General Holder's FOIA GuidelinesPresident Obama's FOIA Memorandum On his first full day in office, President Obama demonstrated his commitment to the ideals of transparency and openness by issuing a Memorandum to the heads of all Executive Branch departments and agencies calling on them to "renew their commitment to the principles embodied in FOIA."&amp;nbsp; The President directed all agencies to administer the FOIA with a clear presumption in favor of disclosure, to resolve doubts in favor of openness, and to not withhold information based on "speculative or abstract fears."&amp;nbsp;In addition, the President called on agencies to ensure that requests are responded to in "a spirit of cooperation," that disclosures are made timely, and that modern technology is used to make information available to the public even before a request is made.&amp;nbsp; To carry out these responsibilities, the President directed the Attorney General to issue new guidelines governing the FOIA.&amp;nbsp;Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines In accordance with the President's directive, on March 19, 2009, Attorney General Holder issued new FOIA guidelines which called on all agencies to reaffirm the government's "fundamental commitment to open government."&amp;nbsp; The Guidelines stress that the FOIA is to be administered with the presumption of openness called for by the President.&amp;nbsp; The Attorney General strongly encouraged agencies to make discretionary disclosures of information.&amp;nbsp; He also directed agencies not to withhold information simply because they may do so legally and to consider making partial disclosures when full disclosures are not possible.In his FOIA Guidelines the Attorney General also comprehensively addressed the need for each agency to ensure that it has in place an effective system for responding to requests.&amp;nbsp; The Attorney General stressed the importance of proactive disclosures of information, use of technology, and the need to respond to requests promptly.&amp;nbsp; Significantly, in his FOIA Guidelines the Attorney General emphasized that "[e]ach agency must be fully accountable for its administration of the FOIA."Agency Accountability The Attorney General has highlighted the key role played by each agency's Chief FOIA Officer and emphasized that "[i]mproving FOIA performance requires [their] active participation."&amp;nbsp; Accordingly, the Attorney General directed agency Chief FOIA Officers to review "all aspects of their agencies' FOIA administration" and to report each year to the Department of Justice on the steps taken "to improve FOIA operations and facilitate information disclosure at their agencies."The White House, through a memorandum to agency heads sent March 16, 2010, from both the White House Chief of Staff and Counsel to the President, requested that agencies take certain actions "to ensure full implementation of the President's Memorandum on FOIA." Specifically, the March 16, 2010 White House Memorandum asked agencies to ensure that their FOIA guidance and training materials were updated "to include the principles articulated in the President's Memorandum." Second, agencies were asked to assess whether they were "devoting adequate resources to responding to FOIA requests promptly and cooperatively, consistent with the requirements for addressing this Presidential priority." &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Chief FOIA Officer ReportsAgencies submitted their first Chief FOIA Officer Reports in March 2010 and reported on a wide variety of initiatives, big and small, that had been undertaken across the government to improve transparency in keeping with the President's and Attorney General's FOIA Memoranda.&amp;nbsp; OIP prepared an extensive summary of the information contained in those reports and issued guidance to agencies on steps they could take to achieve even greater transparency in the year ahead.Content and Timing of 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports In accordance with the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines, OIP is charged with the responsibility for providing guidance to agencies on the timing and content of agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&amp;nbsp; The guidelines for the 2011 Reports are set out below.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; While the overall topics to be addressed in the reports remain the same as last year, for 2011 the five key areas contain additional, more targeted elements that should be addressed.&amp;nbsp; All agencies should follow these guidelines in preparing and submitting their 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports.After the reports are reviewed and cleared by OIP, they should be posted on each agency's website.&amp;nbsp; OIP, in turn, will make all the Chief FOIA Officer Reports available to the public on the Department of Justice's website.&amp;nbsp; The timing for posting the finalized reports has been moved up one week as compared with 2010.&amp;nbsp; For 2011, agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports should be posted in final form by March 8, 2011.Format of 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports As was done in 2010, agencies should address the five key areas discussed below in their Chief FOIA Officer Reports, specifically:&amp;nbsp; 1) the steps taken to apply the presumption of openness; 2) the steps taken to ensure that there is an efficient and effective system in place for responding to requests; 3) the steps taken to increase proactive disclosures; 4) the steps taken to improve use of technology; and 5) the steps taken to reduce any backlogs of pending FOIA requests.&amp;nbsp;For those agencies that process requests on a decentralized basis, rather than organizing the report by component and then reporting on the five key areas for each component, the report should be organized by the five key areas.&amp;nbsp; Then, within the discussion of each key area the data for the various components should be included.&amp;nbsp; That will make it easier to get a picture of how the agency as a whole is addressing each of the five key areas.&amp;nbsp;A new element has been added for the 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports to allow each agency to spotlight a particular success story from the previous year.&amp;nbsp; At the end of each report there is now a section for agencies to include a transparency success story that they would like to highlight.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Content of 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports Steps Taken to Apply the Presumption of OpennessThe guiding principle underlying the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines is the presumption of openness.&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp; Describe the steps your agency has taken to ensure that the presumption of openness is being applied to all decisions involving the FOIA.&amp;nbsp; To do so, you should answer the questions listed below and then include any additional information you would like to describe how your agency is working to apply the presumption of openness.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a. Describe how&amp;nbsp;the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines have been publicized throughout your agency.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;b.

Give examples of the types of records your agency now posts that used to be available only by making a FOIA request for them.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;d. What system do you have in place to routinely identify records that are appropriate for posting?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;e. How do you utilize social media in disseminating information?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;f. Describe any other steps taken to increase proactive disclosures at your agency.Steps Taken To Greater Utilize TechnologyA key component of the President's FOIA Memorandum was the direction to "use modern technology to inform citizens about what is known and done by their Government."&amp;nbsp; In addition to using the internet to make proactive disclosures, agencies should also be exploring ways to utilize technology in responding to requests.&amp;nbsp; In 2010 agencies reported widespread use of technology in handling FOIA requests.&amp;nbsp; For this section of your Chief FOIA Officer Report for 2011, please answer the following more targeted questions:Electronic receipt of FOIA requests:What proportion of the components within your agency which receive FOIA requests have the capability to receive such requests electronically?To what extent have you increased the number of components doing so since the filing of your last Chief FOIA Officer Report?What methods does your agency use to receive requests electronically?Electronic tracking of FOIA requests:&amp;nbsp;What proportion of components within your agency which receive FOIA requests have the capability to track such requests electronically?To what extent have you increased the number of components doing so since the filing of your last Chief FOIA Officer Report?What methods does your agency use to track requests electronically?Electronic processing of FOIA requests:&amp;nbsp;What proportion of components within your agency which receive FOIA requests have the capability to process such requests electronically?To what extent have you increased the number of components doing so since the filing of your last Chief FOIA Officer Report?What methods does your agency use to process requests electronically?Electronic preparation of your Annual FOIA Report:What type of technology does your agency use to prepare your agency Annual FOIA Report, i.e., specify whether the technology is FOIA-specific or a generic data-processing system.&amp;nbsp;If you are not satisfied with your existing system to prepare your Annual FOIA Report, describe the steps you have taken to increase your use of technology for next year.Steps Taken to Reduce Backlogs and Improve Timeliness in Responding to RequestsImprovements to timeliness in responding to pending FOIA requests and reductions in backlogs are both ongoing agency efforts.&amp;nbsp; The President and the Attorney General have emphasized the importance of improving timeliness in responding to requests.&amp;nbsp; Section XII of your Annual FOIA Report includes figures that show your agency's backlog of pending requests and administrative appeals for the past two fiscal years.&amp;nbsp; You should refer to those numbers when completing this section of your Chief FOIA Officer Report.&amp;nbsp; In this section you should address the following elements.&amp;nbsp;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If your agency has a backlog, report here whether that backlog is decreasing.&amp;nbsp; That reduction should be measured in two ways.&amp;nbsp; First, report whether the number of backlogged requests and backlogged administrative appeals that remain pending at the end of the fiscal year decreased or increased, and by how many, when compared with last fiscal year.&amp;nbsp; Second, report whether your agency closed in Fiscal Year 2010 the ten oldest of those pending requests and appeals from Fiscal Year 2009, and if not, report how many of them your agency did close.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;2.&amp;nbsp; If there has not been a reduction in the backlog as measured by either of these metrics, describe why that has occurred.&amp;nbsp; In doing so, answer the following questions and then include any other additional explanation:Is the backlog increase a result of an increase in the number of incoming requests or appeals?Is the backlog increase caused by a loss of staff?Is the backlog increase caused by an increase in the complexity of the requests received?What other causes, if any, contributed to the increase in backlog?3. Describe the steps your agency is taking to reduce any backlogs and to improve timeliness in responding to requests and administrative appeals. &amp;nbsp;In doing so answer the following questions and then also include any other steps being taken to improve timeliness.Does your agency routinely set goals and monitor the progress of your FOIA caseload?&amp;nbsp;Has your agency increased its FOIA staffing?Has your agency made IT improvements to increase timeliness?Has your agency Chief FOIA Officer been involved in overseeing your agency's capacity to process requests?Spotlight on Success Out of all the activities undertaken by your agency in this last year to increase transparency, describe here one success story that you would like to highlight as emblematic of your efforts.&amp;nbsp;Timing for Submission of 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports In order to appropriately ensure that agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports address all the elements detailed above, each agency must submit a draft of their Chief FOIA Officer Report to OIP for review no later than February 1, 2011.&amp;nbsp; The drafts should be submitted by e-mail to DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov.Each agency Chief FOIA Officer must then submit a finalized Chief FOIA Officer Report to the Department of Justice by March 8, 2011, to the e-mail address noted above.Each agency must also post its Chief FOIA Officer Report on its website by March 8, 2011.Contacts Agencies with questions regarding their 2011 Chief FOIA Officer Reports should contact Vanessa Brinkmann at the Department of Justice's Office of Information Policy at (202) 514-3642.</span>

concrete progress in implementing the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&amp;nbsp; The 2012 assessment shows that agencies are applying the presumption of openness, are taking steps to ensure that they have effective systems in place for responding to requests, are increasing both the content on their websites and its usability, and are offering requesters the opportunity to submit requests electronically.While more than half the agencies are utilizing advanced technology to help with core processing tasks like improved document searches, streamlined consultation processes, and more efficient document review, there are many that have not yet explored those options.&amp;nbsp; In this era of lean resources, as agencies face competing priorities, they understandably may also face challenges in acquiring new technology.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, agencies are encouraged to assess the cost effectiveness as well as the benefits of more advanced technological tools that could be used to achieve greater efficiency in the core elements of FOIA processing, particularly improved document searches and review.As to improving timeliness, agencies that do not currently offer multi-track processing, and which take longer than twenty working days on average to respond to requests, should consider establishing a multi-track system.&amp;nbsp; A multi-track system will provide a mechanism for the agency to process "simple" requests in a different queue from "complex" requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the "simple" track requests.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, by establishing multiple processing tracks, agencies can more readily offer requesters the option of tailoring their request so that it fits within the "simple" track and can be processed more quickly.Lastly, all agencies should make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each year.&amp;nbsp; By doing so systematically, year after year, the government overall will be able to reduce the age of its backlog and eliminate those lingering requests that have remained pending for many years.&amp;nbsp;</span>

                                                                                                                   Guidance for Further Improvement Based on 2013 Chief FOIA OfficerReport Review and Assessment As illustrated by OIP's 2013 Assessment of Agency Progress in Implementing the President's and Attorney General's FOIA Memoranda, agencies have accomplished a great deal over the past year to apply the presumption of openness, make more proactive disclosures, utilize technology for the benefit of FOIA administration, improve timeliness, and reduce backlogs. While the government overall has made significant improvements, the results achieved by individual agencies vary. OIP's Assessment serves as a visual snapshot of where each agency should focus its efforts in the upcoming year to achieve even greater success in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines. To assist agencies, OIP offers the following guidance based on our 2013 Assessment.Focus on Quality TrainingA proper understanding of the FOIA, including the correct application of the statute's provisions and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines, is the first step towards any successful FOIA operation. OIP's Assessment shows that the vast majority of agencies are either holding training conferences or sending their FOIA professionals to training hosted by other agencies. These efforts vary by agency, though, with some agencies citing one or two training sessions attended by staff and others hosting multiple FOIA conferences and having all of their FOIA professionals attend regular training.OIP advises every agency to make FOIA training available to all their FOIA professionals at least once each year. Moreover, it is essential that FOIA training programs cover core, substantive aspects of FOIA administration. Agencies that have been engaged in robust training initiatives should continue these efforts. Agencies that are in need of training are encouraged to take advantage of the many FOIA training opportunities available around the government or to plan a comprehensive FOIA conference tailored to the needs of their own agency. OIP regularly conducts a number of government-wide training sessions that cover all aspects of the FOIA. OIP's subject matter experts are also available to provide specialized training for agencies on any FOIA topic. For more information about OIP's upcoming training events and how to attend please visit the "Training" page of our website. In addition, agencies can contact OIP’s Training Officer to arrange for assistance in holding an in-house training program.Focus on Processing “Simple” Track Requests Within Twenty Working DaysThe Attorney General has emphasized that "[t]imely disclosure of information is an essential component of transparency." The government overall showed improvement on this front with sixty-three agencies processing their "simple track" requests within an average of twenty days or less and several more being very close to meeting this goal. However, there are still a number of agencies with longer processing times. Agencies that are taking longer than an average of twenty days to process their simple requests should reexamine their FOIA process and strive to meet this milestone. Furthermore, OIP advises those agencies with high processing times that have not established multi-track processing to consider doing so. As explained in last year's guidance, multi-track systems provide a mechanism for agencies to process their simple requests in a different queue from their complex requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the simple requests. Differentiating the processing queues also allows agencies to provide requesters with meaningful choices regarding processing times, based on the complexity of the request.Focus on Closing the “Ten Oldest”Finally, all agencies should continue to make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each fiscal year. Our sustained efforts to close these requests and appeals every year is essential to reducing the age of the government's backlogs and resolving those cases that have been lingering for years.In addition to closing their oldest requests and appeals, for those agencies that receive consultations from other agencies it is equally important to close their ten oldest pending consultations. This ensures that the agencies that sent the consultations can have the responses they need in order to close out the requests.</span>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The Importance of Good Communication with FOIA RequestersAs we approach Sunshine Week, which commemorates the anniversary of the birthday of President James Madison, who is considered the Founding Father of open government, we are likewise approaching the one-year anniversary of Attorney General Holder's FOIA Guidelines. Those FOIA Guidelines were designed to underscore our country's "fundamental commitment to open government." The Guidelines address a range of issues related to the presumption of openness, the need for agencies to establish an effective system for responding to requests, and the obligation to disclose information promptly and proactively.Significantly, the FOIA Guidelines also stress that agencies "must be mindful of their obligation to work 'in a spirit of cooperation' with FOIA requesters," as directed by President Obama in his FOIA Memorandum. Moreover, Attorney General Holder cautioned agencies that "[u]neccessary bureaucratic hurdles have no place in the 'new era of open Government' that the President has proclaimed." Thus, it is important for agencies to be mindful of the manner in which they interact with the pivotal player in every FOIA request - the FOIA requester. Establishing good communication and working cooperatively with FOIA requesters is a very simple and yet essential element to ensuring that each agency's FOIA process is working in accordance with the President's and Attorney General's directives.There are a number of areas where improved communication with FOIA requesters holds great promise for improving FOIA administration.Providing Agency Contact Information OIP has long advised agencies to provide each FOIA requester with the name and phone number of the FOIA professional handling his or her request. Although many agencies already routinely provide such contact information to FOIA requesters, all agencies should ensure that they do so. This is a fundamental courtesy which should readily be extended to all FOIA requesters.Discussing the Scope and Status of the Request The FOIA has a number of provisions that require agencies to contact requesters. Whenever a request involves "unusual circumstances" and the agency determines that it must extend the time to respond by more than ten working days, the agency is required to notify the requester and give him or her an opportunity to limit the scope of the request or to arrange for an alternative time to process it. The FOIA also requires agencies to establish a telephone line or Internet service to provide requesters with the status of their requests. In carrying out these statutory requirements agencies should ensure that their communication with requesters is prompt and helpful.Good communication with requesters can also be exceedingly helpful in those instances where an agency is uncertain about the scope of what is being requested. By engaging in a dialogue with the requester, both parties can ensure that they have a common understanding of what records are being sought. Similarly, when a request will involve a far-ranging or time-consuming search, it is often helpful to contact the requester to discuss what steps will be involved in order to process that particular request. Often these conversations will allow the FOIA requester and the FOIA professional to collaborate on a plan for responding to a complex request. Many times FOIA requesters do not know how agency records are organized or what might be involved in searching for the records they seek. Having the ability to talk through an approach to the request and reach an understanding can be very helpful to both the requester and the agency.Making Interim Responses as Processing Proceeds When an agency is working on a request that involves a voluminous amount of material or which involves searches in multiple locations, whenever feasible, the agency should provide the requester with interim responses rather than waiting until all records are located and processed. Although there are situations where records need to be reviewed in their totality to ensure proper handling, in other cases rolling releases of records are possible. Whenever such rolling releases are possible the agency should make them to facilitate access to the requested records.Limiting "Still-Interested" Letters or Phone Calls On occasion, when the passage of time or a change in circumstance gives rise to a question of whether a FOIA requester is still interested in obtaining the requested records, many agencies contact the requester to inquire whether he or she is still interested in having the request processed. When done judiciously, this is entirely appropriate because agency resources should not be expended on processing a request when the requester is no longer interested in the records. At the same time, agencies should be mindful that FOIA requesters can misinterpret the intent behind a letter or phone call inquiring whether the requester remains interested in the request. So this is yet another area where it is important to be mindful of the manner in which such inquiries are made. In particular, absent good cause, an agency should not inquire more than once whether a requester is still interested in the request. Agencies should also afford requesters a reasonable amount of time to indicate their continued interest and should ensure that there is a simple way for requesters to do so.Conclusion All of these simple practices can go a long way to ensuring that agencies are working with FOIA requesters in the "spirit of cooperation" that the President and Attorney General directed. There is no doubt that implementing an efficient and effective FOIA system is a major undertaking for agencies. Improving communication and working cooperatively with FOIA requesters should be viewed as an essential part of that undertaking.</span>
