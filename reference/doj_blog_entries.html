Sponsored by ICITAP, U.S. Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL), and the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism (CT), partner-nation officials and ICITAP personnel included delegates from 17 partner countries: Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Indonesia, Jordan, Kosovo, Montenegro, Nepal, North Macedonia, Oman, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. With guidance from ICITAP, the international police delegates had access to uniquely productive and powerful discussions with U.S. and international colleagues. Topics ranged from building public trust, human rights, counter terrorism, Women, Peace, and Security (WPS), training, community engagement, technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and good police practices. In addition to the International Track of special presentations, amenities that facilitated dialogue and new partnerships included special access to an International Hospitality Lounge and International Delegates Luncheon. Observations by delegates were overwhelmingly positive and appreciative about what they learned and could bring home to adapt and emulate. Many delegates said they felt “honored” and even “overwhelmed” to be selected, participate, and gained from the opportunities to learn. Attended by more than 17,000 public safety professionals, the three tenets of the IACP conference are training, networking, and exhibit hall education featuring more than 600 companies showcasing relevant products and services. Importantly, with the addition in 2024 of the "Wordly" AI-powered translation App, the nearly 200 IACP presentations and meetings were available to all attendees in over 60 languages (spoken and written). Delegates complimented the new language access system. These significant improvements in language access and events will cause international participation at the IACP Conference to grow even further than the more than 1,200 international police delegates who attended this year. The IACP Conference is a consistently reliable, interactive event where police learn new techniques, advance their knowledge and careers, and equip their departments for ongoing success. With 34,000 members in over 170 countries, the IACP is the world’s largest professional association for police leaders. All ICITAP attendees are now members of the IACP and IACP International Managers of Police Academy and College Training (IMPACT) Section. The IACP and IMPACT Section annual memberships allow members access to IACP policies, to network, and to gain from emailed policing information including webinars, good practices, and Quarterly IACP IMPACT Section international police Zoom meetings and presentations. Several ICITAP employees and contractors hold key positions in the leadership of the IACP and IACP IMPACT Section, which greatly enhances international police opportunities for all attendees hosted through ICITAP.</span>

Conversatorios are conversations between the judicial actors, including judges, prosecutors, defense and / or any other pertinent parties such as forensics experts, child advocates, etc. The goal is the creation of a space for honest dialogue to address and solve issues or problems that may arise in the administration and practice of justice in the state. This session was a first for the state of Guanajuato. Among those present were the President of the Supreme Court of Justice and Counselor of the Judicial Branch of the State of Guanajuato, and the Attorney General of the State. The Director of the ICITAP CCT Program welcomed the participants, which included approximately 63 public servants, including judges, magistrates, directors and heads of specialized units of Guanajuato’s Judicial Branch and Attorney General's Office, who actively participated in the sessions and discussions. Several public servants expressed their satisfaction with the quality and relevance of the topics addressed, as well as the practical usefulness. Four main topics were addressed at this first Guanajuato session. The first discussion highlighted the importance of presenting solid evidence at the initial appearance as a basis to link the suspect to the case and the need to standardize criteria between judges and prosecutors, which guarantees impartial and effective justice. The second topic was one that will likely affect the entire Mexican system based on a recent ruling by Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the importance of an exhaustive analysis of the data to justify preventive detention, promoting a consistent application of this measure for the benefit of public safety. Next, they discussed the effectiveness of the abbreviated procedure (plea agreement) mechanism to speed up judicial processes, with the commitment of the judiciary and the prosecutor's office to promote its use under the correct circumstances. Lastly, the coordinator for the Women’s Center for Justice discussed a proposal to create a specialized court for family violence and generated consensus on its importance to improve the protection of women and children, a crucial step towards a more inclusive and equitable justice system. This first meeting in Guanajuato between justice actors for the continuous improvement of the criminal justice system reaffirmed the importance of these spaces for discussion and mutual learning. The active participation of the attendees and the constant exchange of ideas is evidence that these forums guide necessary change in the evolution of efficiency, transparency, and practice of the justice system.

                                                 Congress Passes Amendment to Exemption 3 of the FOIAFor the second time in less than two years, Congress has passed an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act. Unlike the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, which addressed a number of procedural issues impacting FOIA administration, but did not change any of the FOIA's nine exemptions, the more recent amendment to the FOIA provides for a substantive change to Exemption 3, which pertains to matters specifically exempted from release by statute.Entitled the "OPEN FOIA Act of 2009," the bill, enacted as section 564 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2010, Pub. L. No. 111-83, 123 Stat. 2142, 2184, was signed by the President on October 28, 2009.The amendment consists of only one section, summarized and discussed below. For the complete text of the DHS Appropriations Act which contains the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, is also available online.Prior to the enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, Exemption 3 authorized the withholding of information "specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) require[d] that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishe[d] particular criteria for withholding or refer[red] to particular types of matters to be withheld." 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3) (2006), amended by OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524.The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 amended Exemption 3 by adding a new requirement that any statute "enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009" must "specifically cite to this paragraph." Thus, the text of Exemption 3 now reads as follows:(b) This section does not apply to matters that are- . . .(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), if that statute- (A)(i) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue; or (ii) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; and (B) if enacted after the date of enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009, specifically cites to this paragraph.&amp;nbsp;118 Stat. at 2184.The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 renumbered what used to be referred to as subparts (A) and (B) of Exemption 3, previously 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(B), to 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A)(i) and 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(3)(A)(ii), respectively, but did not change the substance of those requirements. The OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 then established an additional requirement that statutes enacted after the date of the enactment of the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009 must specifically cite to Exemption 3 of the FOIA in order to qualify under Exemption 3.The OPEN FOIA Act was enacted on October 28, 2009, and so this amendment impacts statutes enacted after that date. In order for any statute enacted after that date to qualify as an Exemption 3 statute, it must satisfy one of the traditional requirements, i.e. it must "require that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue" or "establish particular criteria for withholding or refer to particular types of matters to be withheld." If enacted after October 28, 2009, the statute must meet one additional requirement; it must specifically cite to Exemption 3 in order to qualify as a withholding statute.Agencies are encouraged to contact OIP, through its FOIA Counselor service, with any questions regarding the implementation of the FOIA as amended by the OPEN FOIA Act of 2009.</span>

Documents for Release in Accordance with the OPEN Government ActSection 12 of the OPEN Government Act of 2007, Pub. L. No. 110-175, 121 Stat. 2524, amended Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which contains the requirement that agencies provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information contained in documents that are responsive to FOIA requests. Since the 1996 amendments to the FOIA, agencies have been required to indicate the amount of information deleted on the released portion of the record, unless doing so would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. See Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-231, § 4, 110 Stat. 3048-49 (concluding sentences); see also FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 1, at 6 ("Amendment Implementation Questions"); FOIA Update, Vol. XVIII, No. 2, at 2 ("FOIA Counselor: Questions &amp;amp; Answers"). Moreover, the FOIA provides that if technically feasible, the amount of the withheld information should be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion is made.The OPEN Government Act added one additional requirement to this provision regarding the duty to segregate documents for release. Specifically, Section 12 of the OPEN Government Act provides that when marking documents to indicate the amount of information deleted, and the location of that deletion, agencies should also indicate the exemption being asserted. This straightforward requirement codifies what has been an existing practice for many agencies and follows the approach long recommended by the Office of Information and Privacy (OIP).Amended Segregation ProvisionSection (b) of the FOIA, which contains the FOIA's nine statutory exemptions, also directs agencies to release to FOIA requesters any reasonably segregable, non-exempt information that is contained in those records. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (sentence immediately following exemptions). As amended by the OPEN Government Act, the provision now reads:Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated on the released portion of the record unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b) (amended language in italics).The requirement to provide FOIA requesters with any reasonably segregable, non-exempt portions of the records that are responsive to FOIA requests is a fundamental tenant of the Act. Indeed, courts have long focused on this requirement. See, e.g., Department of Justice Freedom of Information Act Guide (Mar. 2007), at 113-19 ("Reasonably Segregable" Obligation) (collecting cases); id. at 1005-10 ("Reasonably Segregable" Requirements) (likewise collecting cases). Thus, it is important that agencies remain mindful of the need to reasonably segregate and release any non-exempt information whenever they are processing a FOIA request. See, e.g., Stolt-Neilsen Transp. Group Ltd. v. United States, 534 F.3d 728, 734 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (concluding that the district court has an affirmative duty to consider reasonable segregability even if the requester never raised the issue).The remaining elements of the segregation provision, including the new statutory amendment, address how documents should be marked once it is determined that they contain reasonably segregable, non-exempt information. First, the amount of information that is being withheld, and now also the exemption under which the withholding is being made, should be indicated on the released portion of the record itself. The FOIA has long contained an exception to this requirement for those instances where revealing the amount and location of the information being redacted would harm an interest protected by the exemption being asserted. This exception now also includes the situation where revealing the exemption itself on the face of the released-in-part document would harm an interest protected by the exemption. In such rare circumstances, the agency need not mark the released portion of the document in such a way that by doing so would cause harm to an interest protected by the exemption being asserted.For example, if a portion of an otherwise releaseable document is being protected under Exemption 7(A) to prevent interference with an on-going law enforcement investigation, and if the agency determines that indicating the amount of information being deleted under that exemption, or now, that marking Exemption 7(A) on that portion of the document will, in context with the released portions of the record, interfere with the on-going investigation, then the agency need not include those markings on that particular record. Such situations will be rare, however, and any agency processing a request which raises questions as to whether the FOIA's marking provisions apply to a given document are encouraged to contact OIP.In the vast majority of cases, the exception to the marking requirement is not applicable. As a result, the three marking requirements will ordinarily apply. Those requirements direct agencies to indicate the amount of information being withheld on the released portion of the record itself. As a result of the OPEN Government Act, agencies must now also mark the document to show the exemption under which the deletion is being made. The third marking requirement provides that agencies must, if technically feasible, place that indication as to the amount of information being deleted and the exemption being asserted, at the place in the record where the deletion occurs. Thus, a FOIA requester reviewing documents released in part would be able to see directly, in the context of the released portions of the document, how much material has been withheld, the exemption used to make the withholding, and where within the document the deletion occurred.Marking Documents for ReleaseFor most records the marking requirements will be readily met by "blacking out" or otherwise physically marking through the protected information in the record and then inserting a notation regarding the exemption being asserted for that particular deletion. The volume of the withheld material will be apparent from the "blacked out" portions, as will the location within the document where the excision occurs.In light of this, it is important that agencies do not "white out" information when withholding it under the FOIA, as that can make it difficult for a requester to identify the amount of withheld material and its location within a document. Instead, agencies must mark documents in a way that makes it readily apparent to the requester where within a document information has been withheld. This can be accomplished by darkening, or "blacking out" the withheld portions of the documents, or by inserting brackets around them, or by outlining or "boxing" them, or any other method that ensures that a requester can easily discern where the redactions have been made. Further, each page containing redactions should be marked to show the amount of information being withheld and the exemption being asserted and, if technically feasible, those markings should be placed at the point in the record where the deletion occurs.The following examples demonstrate several possible approaches to marking documents so that the newly added requirement to specify the exemption being asserted is met. One of the clearest ways to do that is to insert a notation as to the exemption being asserted within the space that remains after the information has been excised.When a paragraph or group of paragraphs are withheld on a page, the exemption(s) used to protect the information in the paragraphs may similarly be noted within the marked-out space.Yet another approach is to use an arrow to connect a particular redaction to the annotation indicating the applicable exemption(s), or to include the exemption notation at the end of the line where the excision occurs.These examples are illustrative and are not intended to be exclusive. Agencies will likely employ a variety of techniques to mark documents depending on the nature of the documents at issue and the redaction capabilities of the agency. The key requirement for agencies when marking documents that will be released in part is to comply with the overall purpose of the segregation provision which is to readily reveal to a requester the amount of information being withheld in a document, its location within that document, and the exemption being asserted for that redaction.ConclusionAgencies have long been required to segregate documents for release and to mark those documents to indicate the amount of information deleted and, ordinarily, the location of the deletion. The new statutory provisions of the OPEN Government Act simply add the next logical step to that requirement, mandating that the exemption being asserted in connection with a given deletion be indicated directly at the place of the deletion. The purpose of the amendment is to make it plain on the face of any record disclosed in part the agency's statutory basis for each discrete withholding contained within the document.</span>

                            Open Format Requirements for Agency Annual FOIA ReportsFor the Fiscal Year 2011 Annual FOIA Reports, OIP will once again be providing agencies with an Excel tool to be used in creating their report.&amp;nbsp; This tool, which is very similar to the one that OIP distributed last year, has many features to assist agencies in compiling their data, including built-in math checks.&amp;nbsp; The tool will also generate the Annual FOIA Report in an open format, which is required by the Open Government Directive and is used to upload data onto FOIA.Gov.&amp;nbsp; OIP anticipates sending agencies a link which will allow agencies to download the updated tool prior to the refresher training on Annual FOIA Reports that will be held this Fall.&amp;nbsp; Agencies should also publish their 2011 Annual FOIA Report in the PDF or similar human-readable format traditionally used for publishing Annual FOIA Reports.</span>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Using Metadata in FOIA Documents Posted Online to Lay the Foundationfor Building a Government-Wide FOIA Library On April 9, 2012, the Department of Justice released version 2.0 of its Open Government Plan which detailed the Department’s “ongoing and anticipated efforts to increase openness” and which announced new Department initiatives concerning the administration of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).&amp;nbsp; A key FOIA initiative in the Department’s Open Government Plan is the development of metadata standards “that will facilitate the ability of interested persons to search for and retrieve documents across websites and disparate record keeping systems.”&amp;nbsp;Put simply, metadata is “data about data.” &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Metadata provides a description and important facts about material that is posted online and is itself machine-readable and can be searched by other computers.&amp;nbsp; When related documents, such as FOIA documents that are proactively disclosed in agency FOIA Libraries, are posted with uniform metadata it is far easier to locate them during a search of the Internet.&amp;nbsp; Because of the value that metadata adds to search capabilities, the Department’s Office of Information Policy (OIP) is introducing a uniform metadata “FOIA tag” for agencies to use when they post FOIA processed data and documents online in agency FOIA Libraries.Through the consistent use of this standardized “FOIA tag” in posting records in their own FOIA Libraries as outlined below agencies will in effect create a “virtual” government-wide FOIA Library by allowing the public to run simple, topical keyword searches that will efficiently retrieve documents from across the universe of Federal government FOIA Libraries.&amp;nbsp; Such searches will be able to be conducted naturally through commercial search engines that are already used by millions of people every day, by combining any topical keyword with the term “FOIA.”&amp;nbsp; OIP will be issuing further guidance to agencies on this topic in the months ahead and plans to customize features on FOIA.gov so that users have the option to access all FOIA-tagged documents across the federal government from one single location.&amp;nbsp;Evolution of Proactive Disclosures under the FOIASubsection (a)(2) of the FOIA requires agencies to “make available for public inspection and copying” four categories of records.&amp;nbsp; 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(2) (2006 &amp;amp; Supp. IV. 2010).&amp;nbsp; The first three categories, which collectively can be referred to as “operational” records, consist of final opinions made in the adjudication of cases, policy statements, and administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public.&amp;nbsp; Id. § 552(a)(2)(A-C).&amp;nbsp; The fourth category, which is referred to as “FOIA-processed” records, consists of records requested under the FOIA which “have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Id. § 552(a)(2)(D).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When agencies make these records available it is known as making a “proactive disclosure.”&amp;nbsp; The Department’s Guide to the Freedom of Information Act provides detailed information about the FOIA’s proactive disclosure requirements.&amp;nbsp;In addition to the proactive disclosures that are required by the FOIA statute, the President has directed agencies to “take affirmative steps to make information public,” without “wait[ing] for specific requests from the public,” and the Attorney General, in his FOIA Guidelines, has directed agencies to “readily and systematically post information online in advance of any public request.”&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Thus, in compliance with these directives, agencies are engaged in an ongoing process of identifying information of interest to the public that can be made available online without the need to make a FOIA request.&amp;nbsp;Historically, agencies made proactive disclosures by placing hard copies of the records in dedicated places in their buildings, known as “Reading Rooms.”&amp;nbsp; With the passage of the e-FOIA Amendments of 1996, agencies were required to use “computer telecommunications” or “other electronic means” to make proactive disclosures of records created after November 1, 1996. &amp;nbsp;As a result, while some agencies still maintained physical Reading Rooms, over time, agencies established “electronic Reading Rooms” which were dedicated pages on agency FOIA websites where proactive disclosures were posted.&amp;nbsp; More recently, even electronic Reading Rooms are being re-imagined as agencies make documents available online in a more organic fashion, posting them throughout their overall agency websites in locations where users are more likely to look for them.&amp;nbsp;In March 2010, OIP introduced the concept of the online “FOIA Library,” providing a centralized location for agency FOIA disclosures while allowing greater flexibility for agencies to post records wherever, and in whatever format, best meets their own needs and the needs of the community of individuals who access their websites.&amp;nbsp; While proactively disclosed documents generally may be posted throughout agency websites, at a minimum, agencies should include FOIA-processed documents (such as “frequently requested” records and any other records that have been disclosed pursuant to a FOIA request that an agency chooses to post online) in their designated FOIA Libraries.&amp;nbsp; Additional information on the requirements for the electronic availability of proactive disclosures is available in the Department’s Guide to the Freedom of Information Act.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Agency websites are now the primary mechanism for making proactive disclosures under the FOIA, including both required disclosures pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of the FOIA and additional information that is posted online as a matter of agency discretion.&amp;nbsp; Agencies have overwhelmingly embraced proactive disclosures as a way to provide the public with information about their activities.&amp;nbsp; The details of those efforts are included each year in agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports and are frequently highlighted in agencies’ Success Stories.&amp;nbsp;Yet, as the volume of material posted to websites increases, the importance of establishing uniform methods to locate it increases as well.&amp;nbsp; Because proactively disclosed FOIA records are posted on websites maintained by 100 federal departments and agencies, and given that information on a given topic often is separately maintained by multiple agencies, it is essential that the public can quickly retrieve records of interest that are posted across these government websites.&amp;nbsp; Technology has allowed agencies to move beyond the days when records had to be physically stored together and organized with paper indices that needed to be reviewed in order to locate material of interest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Today the public is accustomed to using commercial search engines to find information online simply by entering key words.&amp;nbsp; Agencies can ensure that such web searches effectively locate proactive disclosures by consistently utilizing uniform metadata when posting records online, while at the same time, retaining their ability to post their records on their individual agency websites in an organic manner that serves the needs of the frequent visitors to their sites.&amp;nbsp;Enhanced Search Capabilities through the use of MetadataBoth the President and the Attorney General have emphasized the importance of proactive disclosures and greater use of technology in creating a more open government.&amp;nbsp; President Obama has called on agencies to use modern technology and “innovative steps” to make government more collaborative, participatory, and transparent.&amp;nbsp; In order to achieve improved transparency, agencies must make information accessible and usable, not just available.&amp;nbsp;Agencies not only are posting more information online than ever before, they are harnessing the power of social media, creating specially designed topical websites, and providing open format data sets to put a wealth of information into the hands of the public in a variety of different formats.&amp;nbsp; In the FOIA context, agencies frequently still collect documents that are maintained in hard copy paper format.&amp;nbsp; Such paper documents are typically then scanned (e.g. into PDF format) in order to be digitized for posting online.&amp;nbsp; However, the scanning process itself does not create reliable metadata -- for example, the date that a particular document is scanned may automatically “attach” to the document instead of the date that the document was actually created.&amp;nbsp; This can inhibit the locating of particular documents when searched for by the public.&amp;nbsp;Federal agencies should already have processes in place for the inclusion of metadata when posting documents online.&amp;nbsp; Agency FOIA professionals are encouraged to work with their IT staff on the inclusion of metadata in FOIA proactive disclosures.&amp;nbsp; In doing so, agencies should be cognizant of what keywords the public are likely to use in searching for documents online.&amp;nbsp; Relevant fields may include date, document type, subject, author/recipient name, and publishing office, as well as a variety of keywords that would help the public locate pertinent documents.&amp;nbsp; While the content of these fields will vary by document, by adding accurate and relevant metadata based on a document’s content, agencies will increase the likelihood that a document is returned in keyword searches by members of the public.&amp;nbsp; Through this initial guidance and as described below, OIP is now advising agencies to include in their standard metadata a “FOIA tag” so that documents posted in an agency’s FOIA Library are specifically designated as FOIA-related in the metadata associated with the document.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Additional information on the incorporation of metadata into posted documents is available on the General Services Administration’s website HowTo.gov.&amp;nbsp;Currently, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is leading an initiative to address larger issues related to the overall management of government information.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; OIP has collaborated with OMB and OIP’s Guidance applies specifically to the use of metadata in documents posted in agency FOIA Libraries.&amp;nbsp; As further OMB guidance is issued in this area and as agencies and the public gain more experience in utilizing metadata, OIP will provide additional guidance on the implementation and inclusion of metadata standards in FOIA documents posted online.&amp;nbsp; OIP will welcome feedback on the use of FOIA metadata so that we can make further improvements across the government to facilitate the ability of the public to locate FOIA-related material online.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Uniform “FOIA Tag” for Documents Posted in FOIA LibrariesWith the proliferation of information and documents posted across hundreds of government websites, and the growth of material included in FOIA Libraries in particular, there is a growing interest in creating a centralized and efficient way for the public to view all FOIA-related &amp;nbsp;documents on a given topic all at once -- i.e. having &amp;nbsp;access to a government-wide FOIA Library.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; There is a way to do just that.&amp;nbsp; Collectively, all agencies can create a “virtual” government-wide FOIA Library simply by adding “FOIA” as a metadata tag to all documents posted online in their individual FOIA Libraries.&amp;nbsp; This will allow members of the public to pair individualized search terms on the topic they are interested in, such as “Mars rover” or “world population,” with the term “FOIA” and conduct a search of the Internet using a regular search engine in order to identify records that have been tagged with these terms.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, OIP plans to update features on FOIA.gov to enable the public to readily locate all agency documents that contain the FOIA tag, allowing the public to quickly and efficiently identify records on specific topics of interest to them that are located in FOIA Libraries.The addition of this tag should fit within existing procedures for the inclusion of metadata within documents posted by agency web managers.&amp;nbsp; For example, the Appointment Affidavit of Attorney General Holder is a frequently requested Department of Justice record which is posted in PDF format in OIP’s FOIA Library.&amp;nbsp; For this document, relevant metadata fields have been “tagged,” including the new “FOIA” tag, as follows:Document Title:&amp;nbsp; Appointment Affidavit for Attorney General Eric HolderAuthor:&amp;nbsp; Eric HolderAuthor Title:&amp;nbsp; Attorney General of the United StatesKeywords: &amp;nbsp;Holder, OPM-61, Standard Form 61, SF-61, Holder Appointment Affidavit, Appointment, Affidavit, Oath of Office, Oath, 2009, 2/3/2009, FOIAIn the coming months OIP will issue further guidance providing specific instructions for agencies to follow on the inclusion of the “FOIA” tag in the metadata for documents posted online in their FOIA Libraries.&amp;nbsp; That guidance will establish the time frame for implementation of the new tagging system.&amp;nbsp; To prepare, agency personnel should familiarize themselves with this guidance, as well as any other metadata standards required by their individual agencies.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, FOIA personnel should begin identifying documents of significant public interest that are already available in their FOIA Libraries and which would benefit from the addition of the “FOIA” tag.ConclusionThe way that federal agencies make records available to the public, and the way that the public accesses these records, continues to evolve in the Internet era.&amp;nbsp; As the volume of posted material increases, it is vital that the public have a fast and efficient way to locate particular documents that are of interest to them.&amp;nbsp; Our goal is to build off of existing agency procedures and standards for the posting of documents online in order to optimize the public’s ability to locate material of interest while leveraging common search tools that utilize plain language and are familiar to the public.&amp;nbsp; The consistent addition of a FOIA metadata tag to documents posted in agency FOIA Libraries will enable the public to more efficiently locate and retrieve government records that have been made available online pursuant to the FOIA’s proactive disclosure provision.&amp;nbsp; The above guidance lays the groundwork and the foundation for future guidance from OIP and OMB which -- in conjunction with updates to features on FOIA.gov -- will create the first-ever virtual government-wide FOIA Library.&amp;nbsp;</span>

                                                                                                                                                                                  Implementing FOIA's Statutory Exclusion Provisions BackgroundOver twenty-five years ago, in 1986, Congress amended the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to provide special protection for three categories of particularly sensitive law enforcement records. For these three specifically defined categories of records, Congress provided that federal law enforcement agencies "may treat the records as not subject to the requirements of [the FOIA]." 5 U.S.C. § 552(c). These provisions, which are referred to as "exclusions" provide protection in three limited sets of circumstances where publicly acknowledging even the existence of the records could cause harm to law enforcement or national security interests.The Three ExclusionsThe first exclusion protects against disclosure of a pending criminal law enforcement investigation where there is reason to believe that the target is unaware of the investigation and disclosure of its existence could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. The second exclusion, which applies only to records maintained by criminal law enforcement agencies, protects against disclosure of unacknowledged, confidential informants. The third exclusion, which applies only to the FBI, protects against disclosure of foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism records, when the existence of those records is classified.The exclusions address three especially sensitive situations arising in the criminal law enforcement or national security context where invoking an exemption will not afford adequate protection because the very act of citing the exemption confirms the existence of the protected records. At the same time, using a "Glomar" response, i.e., a response where the agency neither confirms nor denies the existence of the records, is not viable or practicable because it would need to be applied to a broad range of requests in order to be effective, which would greatly limit the FOIA's access provisions. Indeed, when Congress amended the FOIA to include exclusions, the "neither confirm nor deny" response was already in existence and used by agencies for certain categories of requests. As is explained in the guidance issued by former Attorney General Meese addressing the 1986 amendments to the FOIA, it was because the Glomar response "inadequately protects against the particular harms in question that the more delicate exclusion mechanism, which affords a higher level of protection, sometimes must be employed." The exclusions themselves describe the three narrow categories of records where a "neither confirm nor deny" response would not be adequate.For example, when a criminal law enforcement investigation is ongoing, and the target is unaware that it is pending, but suspects that he is under investigation, he might make a FOIA request for records on himself to see if he could find out whether he was being investigated. If the agency were to respond by advising the requester that it did, in fact, have records responsive to his request, but they were being withheld under Exemption 7(A), which protects records when disclosure could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, the assertion of the exemption by the agency would reveal to the requester the very thing the agency needed to protect, i.e., the existence of the ongoing investigation.If the agency were to respond by saying it could neither confirm nor deny the existence of records, i.e., provide a Glomar response, it would have to answer that way for all requests where someone asked for records on themselves, because a Glomar response is not effective unless it is used for all similar requests. That, in turn, would mean that the vast majority of requesters seeking records on themselves would receive Glomar responses, even though the chance that any particular requester was the target of an investigation covered by an exclusion would be extremely low.To avoid both of these scenarios, exclusions authorize the agency to "treat the records as not subject to the requirements of the [FOIA]." This permits an agency to respond to a request seeking excluded records without revealing their existence, while also allowing the agency to respond to the vast majority of requests in the traditional manner, i.e., by advising the requester whether records exist, and if they do, by releasing any information that is not exempt and asserting exemptions for any material properly protected from disclosure.In another example, if a criminal enterprise suspected it was infiltrated by an informant, it could try to uncover the suspected informant by using the FOIA. The enterprise could require the suspected informant to provide a privacy waiver and then could make a FOIA request to a law enforcement agency such as the FBI seeking any records on that individual. The submission of the privacy waiver would preclude the criminal law enforcement agency from using a privacy-based Glomar response. Without the exclusion, the law enforcement agency which was working with that informant in the criminal enterprise would be in an untenable position. Invoking Exemption 7(D), which protects confidential informants, would tip off the criminal enterprise that indeed it had been infiltrated. To address just such a scenario, the second exclusion removes criminal law enforcement informant records from the requirements of the FOIA, when they are requested by a third party, thereby providing protection for the confidential informant.For all three exclusions, the records are removed from the requirements of the FOIA only during the time that the specific requirements of each exclusion are met. Thus, once the target of a criminal law enforcement investigation becomes aware of the existence of the ongoing investigation, the first exclusion would no longer apply. Similarly, once a confidential informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed the second exclusion would no longer apply. Finally, when the existence of FBI foreign intelligence, counterintelligence, or international terrorism records is no longer classified, the third exclusion would not apply.Handling of Excluded Records Under the Meese GuidelinesSince 1987, agencies have handled records excluded under these provisions according to the publicly available guidelines issued by Attorney General Meese. The Meese Guidance provided, among other things, that where the only records responsive to a request were excluded from FOIA by statute, "a requester can properly be advised in such a situation that 'there exist no records responsive to your FOIA request.'" The Meese Guidance also stated that it was "essential that all agencies that could potentially employ at least one of the three exclusions ensure that their FOIA communications are consistently phrased accordingly." Otherwise the protection afforded by the exclusion could be "undermined, even indirectly, by the form or substance of an agency's actions." These practices laid out in Attorney General Meese's Guidance have governed agency practice for more than twenty-five years.Increased Transparency and Accountability Regarding ExclusionsThe Department has examined those past practices governing use of exclusions to determine whether there are ways to bring greater accountability and transparency to the existence and use of exclusions in the FOIA without compromising the important national security and law enforcement interests that are at stake. As a result of that review, the Department has determined that there are a series of steps that agencies should take going forward that will achieve these goals.Consultation with Office of Information PolicyAs a threshold matter, given the unusual nature of the exclusion provisions, the limited circumstances in which they apply, and the relative infrequency with which they are employed, any agency considering whether to invoke an exclusion should consult first with the Office of Information Policy. This will help ensure that all aspects of the request and possible excludable records are reviewed and analyzed before determining whether use of an exclusion is warranted.&amp;nbsp;Public Reporting on Exclusion UseIn order to have a greater understanding of the government's use of exclusions, it is important for the public to know how often exclusions are invoked and by which agencies. To accomplish that, the Department has established a new reporting requirement that directs agencies to publicly report each year on the number of times, if any, that they invoked an exclusion. This reporting will be required yearly, as part of each agency's Chief FOIA Officer Report.This new reporting requirement began with the 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Reports and immediately revealed the limited number of times exclusions had been invoked. Only three agencies out of the ninety-nine subject to the FOIA in Fiscal Year 2011 reported having invoked an exclusion during the preceding fiscal year. Those agencies were the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security, and EPA, which has some criminal law enforcement responsibilities.Specifically, the Department of Justice reported using exclusions in 147 requests out of the 63,992 requests that were processed in Fiscal Year 2011. The Department of Homeland Security reported using exclusions in less than twenty-eight requests out of the 145,631 requests processed in Fiscal Year 2011, and EPA reported using an exclusion three times out of the 10,435 requests it processed during that fiscal year. In total, out of 631,424 requests processed across the government in Fiscal Year 2011, exclusions were invoked in less than 178 cases, which is 0.03% of all processed requests. Because of this new public reporting requirement, interested members of the public can now readily see the extremely limited number of cases in which exclusions are invoked.&amp;nbsp;Description of Exclusions on Agency FOIA WebsitesIn addition to public reporting, each agency can bring greater transparency to the topic of exclusions by ensuring that their FOIA website contains a brief description of the three statutory exclusions. In that way, when a member of the public is reviewing an agency's FOIA website in anticipation of making a FOIA request, he or she will be made aware of the fact that in addition to the nine exemptions to the FOIA there are also three narrow categories of records that can be excluded. An agency's FOIA Reference Guide is a logical place to include such a description.&amp;nbsp;Individual Notification in Response Letters Because exclusions are limited to criminal law enforcement records or to certain national security records of the FBI, most agencies will never have occasion to invoke an exclusion. That fact is evident from the public reporting that the Department of Justice now requires and which showed that in Fiscal Year 2011 only three agencies used an exclusion.While their use is quite limited, the Department is hereby changing its previous guidance concerning how law enforcement components where excluded records might exist should word their responses to FOIA requests. Going forward, when a component that maintains criminal law enforcement records responds to a request, it should notify the requester that the FOIA excludes certain records from the requirements of the FOIA and that the agency’s response addresses only those records that are subject to the FOIA. To ensure that these notifications do not themselves reveal the existence of excluded records in a particular case, those components of agencies that maintain criminal law enforcement records and might possibly use an exclusion should include the notification in response to all their requests.For example, the FBI and Federal Bureau of Prisons within the Department of Justice, as well as U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which are all agency components that maintain criminal law enforcement records, should include the notification in all their response letters. Beyond DHS and the Department of Justice, there are other agencies with components that maintain criminal law enforcement records, such as EPA's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, or any agency's Office of Inspector General. These agency components should likewise be including a notification about exclusions in response to all their requests.Including such a notification represents a fresh approach to the handling of exclusions. This approach both informs requesters of the existence of the statutory exclusions in general, but does not acknowledge the existence of any excluded records in response to any specific request. This new approach will thus preserve the important law enforcement and national security interests that formed the basis for Congress’ inclusion of exclusions in the FOIA over twenty-five years ago, while at the same time be in keeping with Attorney General Holder’s commitment to open government.4(a). Content of New Language Addressing Exclusions for Response LettersBecause exclusions are limited to criminal law enforcement records or certain national security-related records maintained by the FBI, the FBI and all agency components that maintain criminal law enforcement records should include the following language in response to all their requests:“For your information, Congress excluded three discrete categories of law enforcement and national security records from the requirements of the FOIA. See 5 U.S.C. 552(c). This response is limited to those records that are subject to the requirements of the FOIA. This is a standard notification that is given to all our requesters and should not be taken as an indication that excluded records do, or do not, exist.”This language should be a standard notification that is included in the FOIA responses of the FBI and other agency components that maintain criminal law enforcement records.4(b). Impact of Notification Significantly, in the limited circumstances where an exclusion is actually invoked, this new notification requirement will ensure that the agency is providing to the requester in its response letter three important facts. The letter with the notification will:advise the requester of the existence of the three statutory exclusions,inform the requester that excluded records are not subject to the requirements of the FOIA, andput the requester on notice that any excluded records are not part of the response being provided by the agency.With the excluded records addressed by virtue of this notification, the criminal law enforcement component can then respond to the remainder of the request in the usual way, advising the requester of the handling of any records that exist that are subject to the FOIA. This new, more transparent approach will provide requesters with a clear explanation of the agency’s actions and the reasoning behind the handling of requests.ConclusionThis guidance is intended to provide greater transparency and accountability to a distinct aspect of the FOIA, which while used in a very limited number of cases, is expressly part of the FOIA statute and is necessary to protect vital law enforcement and national security interests. Using this multi-layered approach to implementing the FOIA's statutory exclusion provisions will ensure that the public is better informed about the existence of records that are "excluded" or outside the requirements of the FOIA.The new reporting requirement contained in Chief FOIA Officer Reports will allow the public to readily see the extent to which exclusions are employed each year and by which agencies. The description of exclusions on agency websites will further increase public understanding of this distinct part of the law. Lastly, this new approach ensures that requesters to law enforcement components where excluded records might exist are advised that there are records outside the requirements of the FOIA and that such records are not part of the agency's response. At the same time, because the notification will be included in any response made by a criminal law enforcement component, its inclusion will not reveal in any specific case whether excluded records were located or not. In its totality this new approach will ensure greater transparency and accountability in the handling of statutory exclusions.&amp;nbsp;</span>
