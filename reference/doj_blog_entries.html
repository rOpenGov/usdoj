Frock Brothers Trucking, Inc., et al.No. 1:24-CR-00250 (Middle District of Pennsylvania)AUSA William BeheOn October 1, 2024, Frock Brothers Trucking, Inc. (Frock), pleaded guilty to conspiracy and violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) for tampering with the emission control systems of several of their heavy-duty fleet trucks. The company admitted to disabling emission controls in violation of the CAA (18 U.S.C. § 371 and 42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(2)(C)). The company is set for sentencing on January 9, 2025.Frock, a long-distance trucking company based in New Oxford, Pennsylvania, transports a variety of goods, including snack foods, refrigerated items, and produce. Ed Frock owned the company until his death in August 2022.Between November 13, 2018, and December 28, 2018, Frock contracted with co-defendant Leon Martin, a mechanic who operated out of his home, to disable and/or remove emission control components from eight of their diesel trucks. Martin also tampered with the required onboard diagnostic equipment (OBD) to delete factory-installed emission controls from Frock's heavy duty diesel trucks. Martin's tunes enabled those deleted trucks to operate without emission control devices as required by federal law.Martin pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act. He is scheduled for sentencing on January 7, 2025.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;United States v. Jose V.

Redemption Repairs &amp;amp; PerformanceNo. 4:24-CR-40016 (Western District of Arkansas)AUSA Sydney StanleyOn October 2, 2024, Redemption Repairs &amp;amp; Performance (RRP) pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) for modifying and deleting the emissions control systems of diesel engines and tampering with and rendering inaccurate the vehicles’ onboard diagnostic systems (OBD) (42 U.S.C&amp;nbsp;§ 7413(c)(2)(C)).RRP is a truck repair shop specializing in diesel engine repairs and performance located in Texarkana, Arkansas. Between May 2020 and October 2022, the company falsified, tampered with, and rendered inaccurate monitoring devices required to be maintained and followed under the CAA. After removing or altering the emission control equipment on diesel trucks, RRP modified the diesel trucks’ OBD systems to prevent detection of the removal and disabling of the equipment. The company performed this service on close to 50 vehicles, charging between $2,600-$2,700 per truck.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;United States v. AM/NS Calvert LLCNo. 1:24-CR-00117 (Southern District of Alabama)ECS Senior Counsel Kris DigheAUSA Mike AndersonOn October 10, 2024, AM/NS Calvert LLC (AM/NS), a steel production facility, pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(2)(B)). In addition, the court also sentenced the company to pay a $750,000 fine and complete a three-year term of probation.AM/NS is a joint venture by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel operating in Calvert, Alabama. The company held a CAA permit issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), which required the treatment of certain air emissions for chlorine.&amp;nbsp;In 2015, AM/NS determined it could not meet emissions limits using water and switched to a caustic solution with ADEM's approval.In early 2017, AM/NS went back to using water since the caustic solution was damaging the pipes, necessitating extensive repairs. In August 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and ADEM conducted a joint inspection of the AM/NS Calvert acid regeneration plant. During the inspection, they found that the facility was not using the caustic solution, violating the permit. Further investigation revealed the AM/NS Calvert acid regeneration plant had not used caustic solution for approximately 700 days over a two-year period.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.United States v. Wan Yee NgNo. 2:24-CR-00084 (District of Vermont)AUSA Thomas AlibertiECS Senior Counsel Elinor ColbournOn October 11, 2024,&amp;nbsp;Chinese national Wan Yee Ng pleaded guilty to attempting to smuggle eastern box turtles, a protected species, from the United States to Canada (18 U.S.C. § 554).&amp;nbsp;Sentencing is scheduled for December 13, 2024.U.S. Border Patrol agents began surveilling Ng during the spring of 2024, after she rented lodging from a facility near the Canadian border known for illegal smuggling activities.On June 26, 2024, agents observed Ng carrying a duffel bag as she prepared an inflatable kayak on the shore of Lake Wallace. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police notified those agents that two individuals (one believed to be Ng’s spouse) had launched an inflatable watercraft on the Canadian side of the lake and begun paddling southward, toward the United States. Before she could leave the shore, agents intercepted Ng and detained her for suspected smuggling activity.Agents found 29 turtles individually wrapped in socks inside her duffle bag. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife agent preliminarily identified them as eastern box turtles. The pet trade market, especially in China and Hong Kong, highly prizes turtles with colorful markings. These animals are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).The U.S. Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted the investigation with assistance from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Related Press Release: District of Vermont | Woman Charged with Attempted Smuggling of Protected Turtles | United States Department of JusticeUnited States v. Robert G. GambillNo. 5:24-CR-00028 (Western District of North Carolina)AUSA Katherine T. ArmstrongOn October 11, 2024, Robert G. Gambill pleaded guilty to violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act for killing a bald eagle (16 U.S.C. § 668(a)).On June 5, 2024, Gambill shot and killed a bald eagle that was perched in a tree near a bridge in Sparta, North Carolina. After killing the eagle, Gambill drove away from the scene, abandoning the carcass on the bank of the New River. Two witnesses recovered the carcass and turned it over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The U.S. FWS forensic laboratory determined that injuries suffered by the bald eagle were consistent with a gunshot wound from a high-powered rifle.The plea agreement requires Gambill to forfeit his Ruger M77 Mark 2 22-250 rifle and Nikon Monarch MR31 4x16-42 scope.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation, with assistance from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the Alleghany County Sheriff’s Office.United States v. Edwin FloresNo. 3:24-CR-00093 (Southern District of California)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Stephen DaPonteFormer AUSA Melanie PiersonOn October 17, 2024, Edwin Flores pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to failing to present merchandise for inspection by a customs officer (18 U.S.C. § 371). Sentencing is scheduled for January 9, 2025.On April 18, 2024, Flores drove a vehicle over the border from Mexico with three 30-pound cylinders of HCFC-22 that he failed to present for inspection.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division, Homeland Security Investigations, and Customs and Border Protection conducted the investigation.United States v. Keidrick D. Usifo, et al.No. 24-CR-00040 (Eastern District of Arkansas)AUSA Edward WalkerOn October 22, 2024, Keidrick Damond Usifo and Deon Johnson pleaded guilty to violating the Big Cat Public Safety Act (BCPSA)(16 U.S.C. §§ 3372 (e)(1)(A), 3373 (d)).Lawmakers enacted the&amp;nbsp;BCPSA in December 2022 to protect the public by prohibiting the private ownership of big cats, such as tigers and lions, as pets and by prohibiting exhibitors from allowing public contact with big cats, including tiger cubs. This law places new restrictions on the commerce, breeding, possession, and use of certain big cat species.In April 2023, a citizen tipped off local game authorities after seeing a tiger cub in a residential neighborhood in Conway, Arkansas. Further investigation confirmed that Usifo purchased a tiger in March 2023 from a broker in Dallas, Texas, and brought it back to his residence in Arkansas.After a second complaint was filed about the tiger cub, law enforcement conducted a traffic stop on April 21, 2023, arresting Usifo on a felony state warrant. The Conway Police Department then executed a search warrant at Usifo’s residence. The animal was not there, but they found evidence of its presence, including the fact that rooms in the house matched those in photos of the tiger that Usifo posted on Instagram.While in the Pulaski County Detention Facility (PCDF), Usifo made several calls to Johnson. Johnson fed the tiger for Usifo while he was held in detention. Johnson concealed his knowledge of the tiger when questioned by agents.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation, with assistance from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the Conway Police Department, and the Little Rock Police Department.&amp;nbsp;Related Press Release: Eastern District of Arkansas | Defendants Plead Guilty To Violation of The Big Cat Public Safety Act | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of tiger cub illegally purchased by defendant Usifo.United States v.

Sentencing is scheduled for January 22, 2025.Between August 2017 and November 2023, Milliken and Hardway created and sold illegal “delete tune” packages designed to disable and defeat required emissions controls and monitoring systems. Milliken and Hardway created and sold these delete tune files for various customers and vehicles, including numerous Spokane-based trucking companies. Pavel Ivanovich Turlak, and his companies--PT Express, LLC, Spokane Truck Service, LLC, and Pauls Trans, LLC--are scheduled for trial on January 27, 2025.Milliken created and sold custom software delete tunes to Turlak for vehicles based on specifications Turlak outlined. Turlak then charged as much as $3,500 to diesel truck owners to “delete” and “tune” their vehicles by tampering with their pollution monitoring devices. Turlak also fraudulently received more than $300,000 in federal funding designated for eligible small businesses during the pandemic. Charges against Turlak include wire fraud and false claims in connection with this fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 287).The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation with assistance from the EPA National Enforcement Investigations Center, the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, and the Spokane Police Department.United States v. Benjamin GathercoleNo. 3:24-CR-00098 (Eastern District of Virginia)AUSA Heather Hart MansfieldRCEC David LastraOn October 30, 2024, Benjamin Gathercole pleaded guilty to violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for illegally transporting hazardous waste without a manifest (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(5)).Gathercole lived in Tappahannock, Virginia, and worked at a brake manufacturing facility also located in Tappahannock. In 2019, a Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) inspector determined that the brake manufacturing facility failed to make an accurate waste determination for 32 55-gallon drums stored on site. Some of the drums displayed labels noting they contained hazardous waste, but not in accordance with RCRA requirements. The DEQ issued the facility a notice of violation in May 2019.In September and October 2019, Gathercole removed and transported 31 of the 55-gallon drums from the facility to his residence. He dug a near his property and buried the drums in the ground, crushing some of them during the process, and spilling their contents into the ground.In December 2020, a citizen tipped the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about the illegal burial. In November 2021, agents executed a search warrant on the defendant’s property. Gathercole admitted burying the drums at the request of his employer, directing authorities to the burial site. Further testing confirmed the defendant had buried ignitable hazardous waste. The EPA finished excavating the site in November 2022.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division and EPA National Enforcement Investigation Center conducted the investigation.SentencingsUnited States v. Michael MacartneyNo. 2:24-CR-00025 (Eastern District of Virginia)AUSA Elizabeth YusiOn October 1, 2024, a court sentenced Michael Macartney to 40 months’ incarceration, followed by three years’ supervised release, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to create and distribute animal crush videos (18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 48(a)(2),(a)(3)).Between November 2021 and August 2022, Macartney and co-conspirators administered a private online chat group, and participated on other private online chat groups, that used encrypted messaging to fund, view, and distribute videos depicting, among other things, the torture, murder, and sexually sadistic mutilation of animals, specifically, juvenile and adult monkeys. Macartney received more than 300 electronic payments related to this activity.In March 2022, Macartney agreed to sell copies of all his animal crush videos to a co-conspirator for $100. The co-conspirator sent Macartney $75 electronically and Macartney sent the co-conspirator website links to his stored videos. Macartney stated there were just under 2,300 videos.Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation.United States v. Raymond Anthony Rabago Montoya, et al.No. 2:23-CR-01305 (District of Arizona)AUSA Lisa JennisAUSA Stuart ZanderOn October 2, 2024, Raymond Anthony Rabago Montoya was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for his role in a conspiracy to traffic in protected wildlife. In addition, he was ordered to pay $3,000 to the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. This sentence follows a previous conviction for his mother, Griselda Guadalupe Montoya-Gastelum, who received an 18-month prison sentence, also with three years of supervised release. Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Lacey Act for trafficking in protected wildlife (18 U.S.C. § 371; 16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(1)B)).The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began investigating the defendants in August 2022 after receiving a report from a person who purchased four exotic parrots and believed Rabago Montoya had illegally imported the birds. Further investigation determined that the defendants illegally imported exotic and protected wildlife, including tigers, panthers, monkeys, and&amp;nbsp;parrots, from Mexico into the United States.In January 2023, agents executed a search warrant at Carlos Castro’s home, where they found a tiger cub, an alligator, 12 snapping turtles, six tortoises, and boxes of other reptiles. Snapchat messages revealed that Montoya-Gastelum and Castro discussed illegal exotic animal sales and trades. A court in Maricopa County subsequently convicted Castro of Unlawful Sale of Wildlife in the Arizona Superior Court.In April and May of 2023, federal agents received information about spider monkeys being sold on Facebook. They arranged two undercover purchases of the monkeys from the defendants, paying $6,000 each. In June and August 2023, agents arrested Rabago Montoya with dozens of endangered parrots concealed in his vehicle, many of them deceased.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Homeland Security Investigations; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the U.S. Border Patrol, and the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;Related Press Release: &amp;nbsp;District of Arizona | Mother and Son Sentenced for Illegally Importing Endangered Wildlife | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of spider monkey smuggled by defendants.United States v.

Bedra pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to violating the Animal Crush statute for collaborating with others to create and distribute videos depicting acts of extreme violence and abuse against monkeys (18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 48(a)(3)).The conspirators used encrypted chat apps to direct money to individuals in Indonesia willing to commit the requested acts of torture on camera. Bedra also mailed a thumb drive containing 64 videos of monkey torture to a co-conspirator in Wisconsin.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;United States v. Brian Tibbets, et al.Nos. 4:21-CR-00218, 4:22-CR-00282 (District of Idaho)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Cassie BarnumAUSA Francis ZebariECS Law Clerk Amanda BackerOn October 22, 2024, a court sentenced Brian Tibbets to pay a $40,000 fine and complete a five-year term of probation, to include six months’ home confinement. Tibbetts also will perform 1,000 hours of community service. Tibbets pleaded guilty to obstructing a pending proceeding related to a demolition project (18 U.S.C. § 1505). Co-defendant Brek Pilling was sentenced in August 2024 to pay a $100,000 fine, and complete a five-year term of probation, to include three months of home confinement. He also will perform 100 hours of community service. Pilling pleaded guilty to a Clean Air Act negligent endangerment count (42 U.S.C. § 7413).In late 2017, Pilling and Tibbets purchased two buildings in Burley, Idaho, planning to demolish them and build a parking lot. During a walkthrough with city officials, the building inspector pointed out likely asbestos-containing material (ACM). In further communications with the city, other city employees warned the owners about the presence of ACM requiring remediation. The owners took “samples” from the buildings that included wood, brick, and stone (but no building materials that could plausibly be composed of ACM) and submitted those to a forensic lab for analysis.In January 2018, both buildings caught fire under suspicious circumstances. After seeing the fire on the news, a local contractor contacted the defendants and offered to demolish what remained of the buildings using his own asbestos inspector and remediation company. The owners accepted the contractor’s bid but said they would hire their own remediation company. Two days later, the contractor saw the buildings under demolition. The defendants chose to hire an individual to knock them down without conducting any asbestos abatement. During the demolition, individuals hauled several truckloads of debris to a nearby landfill. The owners also lied to an inspector during a subsequent conversation about onsite testing.The National Enforcement Investigation Center analyzed samples taken from the sites and found multiple areas with ACM. Officials ultimately removed approximately 860 tons of asbestos-contaminated demolition debris from the site, at a cost of approximately $845,000.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.United States v. Kyle Potter, et al.No. 3:24-CR-00047 (District of Alaska)AUSA Seth BrickeyOn October 22, 2024, a court sentenced Kyle Potter to pay a $20,000 fine and complete a five-year term of probation. Co-defendant Justin Welch was sentenced on October 1, 2024, to pay a $10,000 fine and complete a three-year term of probation. A restitution hearing is scheduled for December 10, 2024. Potter and Welch pleaded guilty to violating the Lacey Act for their roles in illegally transporting crab from Alaska (16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(2)(A), 3373(d)(1)(B)). Corey Potter is set for a status conference on December 11, 2024.Corey Potter owns two crab catching vessels; Kyle Potter and Welch worked as vessel captains. In February and March 2024, the vessels harvested more than 7,000 pounds of Tanner and Golden king crab in Southeast Alaska. Corey Potter directed Welch and Kyle Potter to take the crab to Seattle, Washington, where they intended to sell it at a higher price than they would have in Alaska. Neither captain landed the harvested crab at a port in Alaska, and they never recorded the harvest on a fish ticket, as required under state law.A large portion of the king crab that arrived in Seattle from Alaska had died and was unmarketable. Corey Potter knew that some of the crab aboard was infected with Bitter Crab Syndrome (BCS), a parasitic disease fatal to crustaceans. Officials were forced to destroy more than 4,000 additional pounds of Tanner crab due to the risk of BCS infection. If the defendants had properly landed the crab in Alaska, authorities could have inspected the harvest and removed the infected crab before leaving Alaska.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation.United States v. Ramiro Hernandez Tziquin, et al.No. 8:23-CR-00058 (District of Nebraska)AUSA Donald KleineAUSA Kimberly BunjerOn October 23, 2024, a court sentenced Ramiro Hernandez Tziquin, a Guatemalan citizen, to time-served for violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. § 668(a)). Tziquin has been in custody since June 6, 2024. Hernandez Tziquin is subject to removal proceedings with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Co-defendant Domingo Zetino Hernandez was sentenced in November 2023 to time served.On February 28, 2023, law enforcement received a report of a suspicious vehicle located at the Wood Duck Wildlife Management Area, located in Stanton County, Nebraska. They found the vehicle and questioned the defendants. Zetino Hernandez admitted that he shot a bird and that it was in the trunk of Hernandez Tziquin’s vehicle. Law enforcement confirmed that the carcass was indeed that of a bald eagle.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, Nebraska Games and Parks Commission, and the Stanton County Sheriff’s Office, conducted the investigation.United States v. Envigo RMS, LLC, et al.No. 6:24-CR-00016 (Western District of Virginia)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Banu RangarajanECS Trial Attorney Sarah BrownECS Paralegal Jillian GrubbAUSA Randy RamseyerAUSA Corey HallAUSA Carrie MaconSAUSA Michelle WelchOn October 24, 2024, a court sentenced Envigo RMS, LLC, and Envigo Global Services, Inc. to pay a total criminal fine of $22 million. Envigo RMS pleaded guilty to conspiring to knowingly violate the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), and Envigo Global Services pleaded guilty to conspiring to knowingly violate the Clean Water Act (CWA) (18 U.S.C. § 371; 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311, 1319(c)(2)(A), 7 U.S.C. § 2149(d)). This case is related to the breeding, export, and sale of dogs for medical and scientific research purposes from a dog breeding facility located in Cumberland County, Virginia. In May 2022, officials rescued more than 4,000 beagles from the premises.As part of the resolution, Inotiv, the parent corporation of Envigo RMS and Envigo Global Services, will guarantee more than $35 million in payments, is subject to increased animal care standards, and engage a compliance monitor. This resolution marks the largest agreed-to fine in an AWA case.Envigo RMS violated the AWA by failing to provide, among other things, adequate veterinary care, adequate staffing, and safe living conditions for dogs housed at the Cumberland County facility. In addition, Envigo Global Services violated the CWA by failing to properly operate and maintain the wastewater treatment plant, leading to massive unlawful discharges of insufficiently treated wastewater into a local waterway. This failure also impacted the health and well-being of the dogs at the facility.In addition to the $22 million fine, the entities will pay approximately $1.1 million to the Virginia Animal Fighting Task Force and approximately $1.9 million to the Humane Society of the United States for direct assistance provided to the investigation. The defendants also will complete five-year terms of probation.The defendants will pay an additional $3.5 million to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to benefit and restore the environment and ecosystems in Cumberland County, with approximately $500,000 dedicated to purchasing riparian wetland or riparian land located in or near Cumberland. They also will spend $7 million to improve their facilities and train personnel over and above the minimum standards required by the AWA.The U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation, with assistance from the Virginia State Police.Related Press Release:&amp;nbsp;Western District of Virginia | Animal Breeder Sentenced in Animal Welfare and Water Pollution Crimes, Will Pay More than $35M, Including Record Fine in Animal Welfare Case | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of beagles rescued from the facility.United States v. AMVAC Chemical Corporation, et al.Nos. 1:24-CR-00043, 1:22-CR-00060 (Southern District of Alabama)ECS Senior Counsel Kris DigheAUSA Michael AndersonRCEC Jennifer LewisECS Paralegal Chloe HarrisOn October 25, 2024, a court sentenced AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) to pay a $400,000 fine and to complete a three-year term of probation. The corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for transporting hazardous waste without a hazardous waste manifest (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(5)).AMVAC is a pesticide manufacturer that produced a pesticide called “Thimet” in Alabama and exported it to Canada, Australia, and other countries. Thimet is an organophosphate insecticide used to control crop pests by absorption into the crops themselves. In 2013, authorities determined that AMVAC was importing tens of thousands of used containers of Thimet through Savannah, Georgia; Port Huron, Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts; and Los Angeles, California. Some of the containers were nearly empty, while others were partially full. The containers were designed to attach directly to farming equipment and then be returned to AMVAC when emptied.The containers were not labeled as containing hazardous waste but as containing product (pesticide) for reformulation. However, the Environmental Protection Agency did not authorized AMVAC to reformulate Thimet. The active ingredient in Thimet is “phorate,” a RCRA acute hazardous waste. AMVAC is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, with specific, known responsibilities under RCRA. AMVAC subsequently told EPA that the pesticide in the containers was imported for disposal. AMVAC failed to use hazardous manifests to transport the containers of waste Thimet to its Alabama facility.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.

(Gremex) to pay a $1.75 million fine, serve a four-year term of probation, and implement an environmental compliance plan. The shipping corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) for failing to maintain an accurate oil record book (ORB) (33 U.S.C. § 1908(a)).Gremex is a Mexican corporation that managed several ships including the&amp;nbsp;M/V Suhar. The Suhar is a 7,602 gross ton Panamanian-flagged ocean-going bulk carrier that routinely hauled cement from Tampico, Mexico, to Pensacola, Florida. Gremex was responsible for the&amp;nbsp;Suhar’s&amp;nbsp;day-to-day operations, including hiring all crew, and ensuring compliance with all environmental and international regulations.The Coast Guard inspected the ship when it arrived in Pensacola on August 25, 2023. Inspectors determined that the vessel’s crew regularly discharged untreated oily bilge water overboard, bypassing onboard pollution control equipment, and falsified the ship’s ORB to conceal these discharges.The U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service conducted the investigation.Related Press Release: Office of Public Affairs | Ship Management Company Fined $1.75M for Failing to Maintain an Accurate Oil Record Book that Concealed Unauthorized Discharges at Sea | United States Department of JusticeUnited States v. Travis J. Branson, et al.No. 9:23-CR-00055 (District of Montana)AUSA Randy TannerAUSA Ryan WeldonOn October 31, 2024, a court sentenced Travis J. Branson to 46 months’ incarceration, followed by 36 months of supervised release. Branson also was ordered to pay $777,250 in restitution into the Lacey Act Reward Fund. Branson pleaded guilty to conspiracy and violations of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Lacey Act. Branson and co-defendant Simon Paul (a fugitive) unlawfully killed bald and golden eagles on the Flathead Indian Reservation and elsewhere in Montana, Idaho, and Nevada, and sold them on the black market (18 U.S.C. § 371; 16 U.S.C. §§ 668(a); 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(1)(B)).Between January 2015 and March 2021, the defendants conspired to illegally kill bald and golden eagles on the Reservation and offer eagle feathers and parts for sale to domestic U.S. and international buyers. Branson traveled from Washington to the Reservation and arranged for Paul to shoot and ship the eagles for him.&amp;nbsp;Confederated Salish &amp;amp; Kootenai tribal authorities&amp;nbsp;tipped off Fish and Wildlife agents to the defendants’ activity.In total, Paul and Branson killed approximately 3,600 birds, including eagles. They then sold eagle feathers and parts on the black market for significant sums of money across the United States and elsewhere. Officials estimated that between 2009 and 2021, Branson made between $180,000 and $360,000 by selling eagles feathers and parts on the black market.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes’ Fish and Game Department conducted the investigation.Related Press Release:&amp;nbsp;District of Montana | Washington man sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison for trafficking eagles, hawks killed on the Flathead Indian Reservation and sold on black market | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of eagle claws illegal sold by defendants.View All Environmental Crimes Bulletins</span>

Frock Brothers Trucking, Inc., et al.No. 1:24-CR-00250 (Middle District of Pennsylvania)AUSA William BeheOn October 1, 2024, Frock Brothers Trucking, Inc. (Frock), pleaded guilty to conspiracy and violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) for tampering with the emission control systems of several of their heavy-duty fleet trucks. The company admitted to disabling emission controls in violation of the CAA (18 U.S.C. § 371 and 42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(2)(C)). The company is set for sentencing on January 9, 2025.Frock, a long-distance trucking company based in New Oxford, Pennsylvania, transports a variety of goods, including snack foods, refrigerated items, and produce. Ed Frock owned the company until his death in August 2022.Between November 13, 2018, and December 28, 2018, Frock contracted with co-defendant Leon Martin, a mechanic who operated out of his home, to disable and/or remove emission control components from eight of their diesel trucks. Martin also tampered with the required onboard diagnostic equipment (OBD) to delete factory-installed emission controls from Frock's heavy duty diesel trucks. Martin's tunes enabled those deleted trucks to operate without emission control devices as required by federal law.Martin pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act. He is scheduled for sentencing on January 7, 2025.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;United States v. Jose V.

Redemption Repairs &amp;amp; PerformanceNo. 4:24-CR-40016 (Western District of Arkansas)AUSA Sydney StanleyOn October 2, 2024, Redemption Repairs &amp;amp; Performance (RRP) pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) for modifying and deleting the emissions control systems of diesel engines and tampering with and rendering inaccurate the vehicles’ onboard diagnostic systems (OBD) (42 U.S.C&amp;nbsp;§ 7413(c)(2)(C)).RRP is a truck repair shop specializing in diesel engine repairs and performance located in Texarkana, Arkansas. Between May 2020 and October 2022, the company falsified, tampered with, and rendered inaccurate monitoring devices required to be maintained and followed under the CAA. After removing or altering the emission control equipment on diesel trucks, RRP modified the diesel trucks’ OBD systems to prevent detection of the removal and disabling of the equipment. The company performed this service on close to 50 vehicles, charging between $2,600-$2,700 per truck.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;United States v. AM/NS Calvert LLCNo. 1:24-CR-00117 (Southern District of Alabama)ECS Senior Counsel Kris DigheAUSA Mike AndersonOn October 10, 2024, AM/NS Calvert LLC (AM/NS), a steel production facility, pleaded guilty to violating the Clean Air Act (CAA) (42 U.S.C. § 7413(c)(2)(B)). In addition, the court also sentenced the company to pay a $750,000 fine and complete a three-year term of probation.AM/NS is a joint venture by ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel operating in Calvert, Alabama. The company held a CAA permit issued by the Alabama Department of Environmental Management (ADEM), which required the treatment of certain air emissions for chlorine.&amp;nbsp;In 2015, AM/NS determined it could not meet emissions limits using water and switched to a caustic solution with ADEM's approval.In early 2017, AM/NS went back to using water since the caustic solution was damaging the pipes, necessitating extensive repairs. In August 2017, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and ADEM conducted a joint inspection of the AM/NS Calvert acid regeneration plant. During the inspection, they found that the facility was not using the caustic solution, violating the permit. Further investigation revealed the AM/NS Calvert acid regeneration plant had not used caustic solution for approximately 700 days over a two-year period.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.United States v. Wan Yee NgNo. 2:24-CR-00084 (District of Vermont)AUSA Thomas AlibertiECS Senior Counsel Elinor ColbournOn October 11, 2024,&amp;nbsp;Chinese national Wan Yee Ng pleaded guilty to attempting to smuggle eastern box turtles, a protected species, from the United States to Canada (18 U.S.C. § 554).&amp;nbsp;Sentencing is scheduled for December 13, 2024.U.S. Border Patrol agents began surveilling Ng during the spring of 2024, after she rented lodging from a facility near the Canadian border known for illegal smuggling activities.On June 26, 2024, agents observed Ng carrying a duffel bag as she prepared an inflatable kayak on the shore of Lake Wallace. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police notified those agents that two individuals (one believed to be Ng’s spouse) had launched an inflatable watercraft on the Canadian side of the lake and begun paddling southward, toward the United States. Before she could leave the shore, agents intercepted Ng and detained her for suspected smuggling activity.Agents found 29 turtles individually wrapped in socks inside her duffle bag. A U.S. Fish and Wildlife agent preliminarily identified them as eastern box turtles. The pet trade market, especially in China and Hong Kong, highly prizes turtles with colorful markings. These animals are protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).The U.S. Border Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service conducted the investigation with assistance from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.Related Press Release: District of Vermont | Woman Charged with Attempted Smuggling of Protected Turtles | United States Department of JusticeUnited States v. Robert G. GambillNo. 5:24-CR-00028 (Western District of North Carolina)AUSA Katherine T. ArmstrongOn October 11, 2024, Robert G. Gambill pleaded guilty to violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act for killing a bald eagle (16 U.S.C. § 668(a)).On June 5, 2024, Gambill shot and killed a bald eagle that was perched in a tree near a bridge in Sparta, North Carolina. After killing the eagle, Gambill drove away from the scene, abandoning the carcass on the bank of the New River. Two witnesses recovered the carcass and turned it over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The U.S. FWS forensic laboratory determined that injuries suffered by the bald eagle were consistent with a gunshot wound from a high-powered rifle.The plea agreement requires Gambill to forfeit his Ruger M77 Mark 2 22-250 rifle and Nikon Monarch MR31 4x16-42 scope.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation, with assistance from the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission and the Alleghany County Sheriff’s Office.United States v. Edwin FloresNo. 3:24-CR-00093 (Southern District of California)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Stephen DaPonteFormer AUSA Melanie PiersonOn October 17, 2024, Edwin Flores pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to failing to present merchandise for inspection by a customs officer (18 U.S.C. § 371). Sentencing is scheduled for January 9, 2025.On April 18, 2024, Flores drove a vehicle over the border from Mexico with three 30-pound cylinders of HCFC-22 that he failed to present for inspection.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division, Homeland Security Investigations, and Customs and Border Protection conducted the investigation.United States v. Keidrick D. Usifo, et al.No. 24-CR-00040 (Eastern District of Arkansas)AUSA Edward WalkerOn October 22, 2024, Keidrick Damond Usifo and Deon Johnson pleaded guilty to violating the Big Cat Public Safety Act (BCPSA)(16 U.S.C. §§ 3372 (e)(1)(A), 3373 (d)).Lawmakers enacted the&amp;nbsp;BCPSA in December 2022 to protect the public by prohibiting the private ownership of big cats, such as tigers and lions, as pets and by prohibiting exhibitors from allowing public contact with big cats, including tiger cubs. This law places new restrictions on the commerce, breeding, possession, and use of certain big cat species.In April 2023, a citizen tipped off local game authorities after seeing a tiger cub in a residential neighborhood in Conway, Arkansas. Further investigation confirmed that Usifo purchased a tiger in March 2023 from a broker in Dallas, Texas, and brought it back to his residence in Arkansas.After a second complaint was filed about the tiger cub, law enforcement conducted a traffic stop on April 21, 2023, arresting Usifo on a felony state warrant. The Conway Police Department then executed a search warrant at Usifo’s residence. The animal was not there, but they found evidence of its presence, including the fact that rooms in the house matched those in photos of the tiger that Usifo posted on Instagram.While in the Pulaski County Detention Facility (PCDF), Usifo made several calls to Johnson. Johnson fed the tiger for Usifo while he was held in detention. Johnson concealed his knowledge of the tiger when questioned by agents.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation, with assistance from the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, the Conway Police Department, and the Little Rock Police Department.&amp;nbsp;Related Press Release: Eastern District of Arkansas | Defendants Plead Guilty To Violation of The Big Cat Public Safety Act | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of tiger cub illegally purchased by defendant Usifo.United States v.

Pavel Ivanovich Turlak, and his companies--PT Express, LLC, Spokane Truck Service, LLC, and Pauls Trans, LLC--are scheduled for trial on January 27, 2025.Milliken created and sold custom software delete tunes to Turlak for vehicles based on specifications Turlak outlined. Turlak then charged as much as $3,500 to diesel truck owners to “delete” and “tune” their vehicles by tampering with their pollution monitoring devices. Turlak also fraudulently received more than $300,000 in federal funding designated for eligible small businesses during the pandemic. Charges against Turlak include wire fraud and false claims in connection with this fraud (18 U.S.C. §§ 1343, 287).The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation with assistance from the EPA National Enforcement Investigations Center, the Small Business Administration Office of Inspector General, and the Spokane Police Department.United States v. Benjamin GathercoleNo. 3:24-CR-00098 (Eastern District of Virginia)AUSA Heather Hart MansfieldRCEC David LastraOn October 30, 2024, Benjamin Gathercole pleaded guilty to violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for illegally transporting hazardous waste without a manifest (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(5)).Gathercole lived in Tappahannock, Virginia, and worked at a brake manufacturing facility also located in Tappahannock. In 2019, a Virginia Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) inspector determined that the brake manufacturing facility failed to make an accurate waste determination for 32 55-gallon drums stored on site. Some of the drums displayed labels noting they contained hazardous waste, but not in accordance with RCRA requirements. The DEQ issued the facility a notice of violation in May 2019.In September and October 2019, Gathercole removed and transported 31 of the 55-gallon drums from the facility to his residence. He dug a near his property and buried the drums in the ground, crushing some of them during the process, and spilling their contents into the ground.In December 2020, a citizen tipped the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency about the illegal burial. In November 2021, agents executed a search warrant on the defendant’s property. Gathercole admitted burying the drums at the request of his employer, directing authorities to the burial site. Further testing confirmed the defendant had buried ignitable hazardous waste. The EPA finished excavating the site in November 2022.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division and EPA National Enforcement Investigation Center conducted the investigation.SentencingsUnited States v. Michael MacartneyNo. 2:24-CR-00025 (Eastern District of Virginia)AUSA Elizabeth YusiOn October 1, 2024, a court sentenced Michael Macartney to 40 months’ incarceration, followed by three years’ supervised release, after pleading guilty to conspiracy to create and distribute animal crush videos (18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 48(a)(2),(a)(3)).Between November 2021 and August 2022, Macartney and co-conspirators administered a private online chat group, and participated on other private online chat groups, that used encrypted messaging to fund, view, and distribute videos depicting, among other things, the torture, murder, and sexually sadistic mutilation of animals, specifically, juvenile and adult monkeys. Macartney received more than 300 electronic payments related to this activity.In March 2022, Macartney agreed to sell copies of all his animal crush videos to a co-conspirator for $100. The co-conspirator sent Macartney $75 electronically and Macartney sent the co-conspirator website links to his stored videos. Macartney stated there were just under 2,300 videos.Homeland Security Investigations conducted the investigation.United States v. Raymond Anthony Rabago Montoya, et al.No. 2:23-CR-01305 (District of Arizona)AUSA Lisa JennisAUSA Stuart ZanderOn October 2, 2024, Raymond Anthony Rabago Montoya was sentenced to 12 months and one day in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for his role in a conspiracy to traffic in protected wildlife. In addition, he was ordered to pay $3,000 to the Cooperative Endangered Species Conservation Fund. This sentence follows a previous conviction for his mother, Griselda Guadalupe Montoya-Gastelum, who received an 18-month prison sentence, also with three years of supervised release. Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring to violate the Lacey Act for trafficking in protected wildlife (18 U.S.C. § 371; 16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(1)B)).The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service began investigating the defendants in August 2022 after receiving a report from a person who purchased four exotic parrots and believed Rabago Montoya had illegally imported the birds. Further investigation determined that the defendants illegally imported exotic and protected wildlife, including tigers, panthers, monkeys, and&amp;nbsp;parrots, from Mexico into the United States.In January 2023, agents executed a search warrant at Carlos Castro’s home, where they found a tiger cub, an alligator, 12 snapping turtles, six tortoises, and boxes of other reptiles. Snapchat messages revealed that Montoya-Gastelum and Castro discussed illegal exotic animal sales and trades. A court in Maricopa County subsequently convicted Castro of Unlawful Sale of Wildlife in the Arizona Superior Court.In April and May of 2023, federal agents received information about spider monkeys being sold on Facebook. They arranged two undercover purchases of the monkeys from the defendants, paying $6,000 each. In June and August 2023, agents arrested Rabago Montoya with dozens of endangered parrots concealed in his vehicle, many of them deceased.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Homeland Security Investigations; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the U.S. Border Patrol, and the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;Related Press Release: &amp;nbsp;District of Arizona | Mother and Son Sentenced for Illegally Importing Endangered Wildlife | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of spider monkey smuggled by defendants.United States v.

Bedra pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to violating the Animal Crush statute for collaborating with others to create and distribute videos depicting acts of extreme violence and abuse against monkeys (18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 48(a)(3)).The conspirators used encrypted chat apps to direct money to individuals in Indonesia willing to commit the requested acts of torture on camera. Bedra also mailed a thumb drive containing 64 videos of monkey torture to a co-conspirator in Wisconsin.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement and the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted the investigation.&amp;nbsp;United States v. Brian Tibbets, et al.Nos. 4:21-CR-00218, 4:22-CR-00282 (District of Idaho)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Cassie BarnumAUSA Francis ZebariECS Law Clerk Amanda BackerOn October 22, 2024, a court sentenced Brian Tibbets to pay a $40,000 fine and complete a five-year term of probation, to include six months’ home confinement. Tibbetts also will perform 1,000 hours of community service. Tibbets pleaded guilty to obstructing a pending proceeding related to a demolition project (18 U.S.C. § 1505). Co-defendant Brek Pilling was sentenced in August 2024 to pay a $100,000 fine, and complete a five-year term of probation, to include three months of home confinement. He also will perform 100 hours of community service. Pilling pleaded guilty to a Clean Air Act negligent endangerment count (42 U.S.C. § 7413).In late 2017, Pilling and Tibbets purchased two buildings in Burley, Idaho, planning to demolish them and build a parking lot. During a walkthrough with city officials, the building inspector pointed out likely asbestos-containing material (ACM). In further communications with the city, other city employees warned the owners about the presence of ACM requiring remediation. The owners took “samples” from the buildings that included wood, brick, and stone (but no building materials that could plausibly be composed of ACM) and submitted those to a forensic lab for analysis.In January 2018, both buildings caught fire under suspicious circumstances. After seeing the fire on the news, a local contractor contacted the defendants and offered to demolish what remained of the buildings using his own asbestos inspector and remediation company. The owners accepted the contractor’s bid but said they would hire their own remediation company. Two days later, the contractor saw the buildings under demolition. The defendants chose to hire an individual to knock them down without conducting any asbestos abatement. During the demolition, individuals hauled several truckloads of debris to a nearby landfill. The owners also lied to an inspector during a subsequent conversation about onsite testing.The National Enforcement Investigation Center analyzed samples taken from the sites and found multiple areas with ACM. Officials ultimately removed approximately 860 tons of asbestos-contaminated demolition debris from the site, at a cost of approximately $845,000.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.United States v. Kyle Potter, et al.No. 3:24-CR-00047 (District of Alaska)AUSA Seth BrickeyOn October 22, 2024, a court sentenced Kyle Potter to pay a $20,000 fine and complete a five-year term of probation. Co-defendant Justin Welch was sentenced on October 1, 2024, to pay a $10,000 fine and complete a three-year term of probation. A restitution hearing is scheduled for December 10, 2024. Potter and Welch pleaded guilty to violating the Lacey Act for their roles in illegally transporting crab from Alaska (16 U.S.C. §§ 3372(a)(2)(A), 3373(d)(1)(B)). Corey Potter is set for a status conference on December 11, 2024.Corey Potter owns two crab catching vessels; Kyle Potter and Welch worked as vessel captains. In February and March 2024, the vessels harvested more than 7,000 pounds of Tanner and Golden king crab in Southeast Alaska. Corey Potter directed Welch and Kyle Potter to take the crab to Seattle, Washington, where they intended to sell it at a higher price than they would have in Alaska. Neither captain landed the harvested crab at a port in Alaska, and they never recorded the harvest on a fish ticket, as required under state law.A large portion of the king crab that arrived in Seattle from Alaska had died and was unmarketable. Corey Potter knew that some of the crab aboard was infected with Bitter Crab Syndrome (BCS), a parasitic disease fatal to crustaceans. Officials were forced to destroy more than 4,000 additional pounds of Tanner crab due to the risk of BCS infection. If the defendants had properly landed the crab in Alaska, authorities could have inspected the harvest and removed the infected crab before leaving Alaska.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Office of Law Enforcement conducted the investigation.United States v. Ramiro Hernandez Tziquin, et al.No. 8:23-CR-00058 (District of Nebraska)AUSA Donald KleineAUSA Kimberly BunjerOn October 23, 2024, a court sentenced Ramiro Hernandez Tziquin, a Guatemalan citizen, to time-served for violating the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. § 668(a)). Tziquin has been in custody since June 6, 2024. Hernandez Tziquin is subject to removal proceedings with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Co-defendant Domingo Zetino Hernandez was sentenced in November 2023 to time served.On February 28, 2023, law enforcement received a report of a suspicious vehicle located at the Wood Duck Wildlife Management Area, located in Stanton County, Nebraska. They found the vehicle and questioned the defendants. Zetino Hernandez admitted that he shot a bird and that it was in the trunk of Hernandez Tziquin’s vehicle. Law enforcement confirmed that the carcass was indeed that of a bald eagle.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Office of Law Enforcement, Nebraska Games and Parks Commission, and the Stanton County Sheriff’s Office, conducted the investigation.United States v. Envigo RMS, LLC, et al.No. 6:24-CR-00016 (Western District of Virginia)ECS Senior Trial Attorney Banu RangarajanECS Trial Attorney Sarah BrownECS Paralegal Jillian GrubbAUSA Randy RamseyerAUSA Corey HallAUSA Carrie MaconSAUSA Michelle WelchOn October 24, 2024, a court sentenced Envigo RMS, LLC, and Envigo Global Services, Inc. to pay a total criminal fine of $22 million. Envigo RMS pleaded guilty to conspiring to knowingly violate the Animal Welfare Act (AWA), and Envigo Global Services pleaded guilty to conspiring to knowingly violate the Clean Water Act (CWA) (18 U.S.C. § 371; 33 U.S.C. §§ 1311, 1319(c)(2)(A), 7 U.S.C. § 2149(d)). This case is related to the breeding, export, and sale of dogs for medical and scientific research purposes from a dog breeding facility located in Cumberland County, Virginia. In May 2022, officials rescued more than 4,000 beagles from the premises.As part of the resolution, Inotiv, the parent corporation of Envigo RMS and Envigo Global Services, will guarantee more than $35 million in payments, is subject to increased animal care standards, and engage a compliance monitor. This resolution marks the largest agreed-to fine in an AWA case.Envigo RMS violated the AWA by failing to provide, among other things, adequate veterinary care, adequate staffing, and safe living conditions for dogs housed at the Cumberland County facility. In addition, Envigo Global Services violated the CWA by failing to properly operate and maintain the wastewater treatment plant, leading to massive unlawful discharges of insufficiently treated wastewater into a local waterway. This failure also impacted the health and well-being of the dogs at the facility.In addition to the $22 million fine, the entities will pay approximately $1.1 million to the Virginia Animal Fighting Task Force and approximately $1.9 million to the Humane Society of the United States for direct assistance provided to the investigation. The defendants also will complete five-year terms of probation.The defendants will pay an additional $3.5 million to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to benefit and restore the environment and ecosystems in Cumberland County, with approximately $500,000 dedicated to purchasing riparian wetland or riparian land located in or near Cumberland. They also will spend $7 million to improve their facilities and train personnel over and above the minimum standards required by the AWA.The U.S. Department of Agriculture Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation, with assistance from the Virginia State Police.Related Press Release:&amp;nbsp;Western District of Virginia | Animal Breeder Sentenced in Animal Welfare and Water Pollution Crimes, Will Pay More than $35M, Including Record Fine in Animal Welfare Case | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of beagles rescued from the facility.United States v. AMVAC Chemical Corporation, et al.Nos. 1:24-CR-00043, 1:22-CR-00060 (Southern District of Alabama)ECS Senior Counsel Kris DigheAUSA Michael AndersonRCEC Jennifer LewisECS Paralegal Chloe HarrisOn October 25, 2024, a court sentenced AMVAC Chemical Corporation (AMVAC) to pay a $400,000 fine and to complete a three-year term of probation. The corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) for transporting hazardous waste without a hazardous waste manifest (42 U.S.C. § 6928(d)(5)).AMVAC is a pesticide manufacturer that produced a pesticide called “Thimet” in Alabama and exported it to Canada, Australia, and other countries. Thimet is an organophosphate insecticide used to control crop pests by absorption into the crops themselves. In 2013, authorities determined that AMVAC was importing tens of thousands of used containers of Thimet through Savannah, Georgia; Port Huron, Michigan; Boston, Massachusetts; and Los Angeles, California. Some of the containers were nearly empty, while others were partially full. The containers were designed to attach directly to farming equipment and then be returned to AMVAC when emptied.The containers were not labeled as containing hazardous waste but as containing product (pesticide) for reformulation. However, the Environmental Protection Agency did not authorized AMVAC to reformulate Thimet. The active ingredient in Thimet is “phorate,” a RCRA acute hazardous waste. AMVAC is a large quantity generator of hazardous waste, with specific, known responsibilities under RCRA. AMVAC subsequently told EPA that the pesticide in the containers was imported for disposal. AMVAC failed to use hazardous manifests to transport the containers of waste Thimet to its Alabama facility.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Criminal Investigation Division conducted the investigation.

(Gremex) to pay a $1.75 million fine, serve a four-year term of probation, and implement an environmental compliance plan. The shipping corporation pleaded guilty to violating the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships (APPS) for failing to maintain an accurate oil record book (ORB) (33 U.S.C. § 1908(a)).Gremex is a Mexican corporation that managed several ships including the&amp;nbsp;M/V Suhar. The Suhar is a 7,602 gross ton Panamanian-flagged ocean-going bulk carrier that routinely hauled cement from Tampico, Mexico, to Pensacola, Florida. Gremex was responsible for the&amp;nbsp;Suhar’s&amp;nbsp;day-to-day operations, including hiring all crew, and ensuring compliance with all environmental and international regulations.The Coast Guard inspected the ship when it arrived in Pensacola on August 25, 2023. Inspectors determined that the vessel’s crew regularly discharged untreated oily bilge water overboard, bypassing onboard pollution control equipment, and falsified the ship’s ORB to conceal these discharges.The U.S. Coast Guard Investigative Service conducted the investigation.Related Press Release: Office of Public Affairs | Ship Management Company Fined $1.75M for Failing to Maintain an Accurate Oil Record Book that Concealed Unauthorized Discharges at Sea | United States Department of JusticeUnited States v. Travis J. Branson, et al.No. 9:23-CR-00055 (District of Montana)AUSA Randy TannerAUSA Ryan WeldonOn October 31, 2024, a court sentenced Travis J. Branson to 46 months’ incarceration, followed by 36 months of supervised release. Branson also was ordered to pay $777,250 in restitution into the Lacey Act Reward Fund. Branson pleaded guilty to conspiracy and violations of the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act and the Lacey Act. Branson and co-defendant Simon Paul (a fugitive) unlawfully killed bald and golden eagles on the Flathead Indian Reservation and elsewhere in Montana, Idaho, and Nevada, and sold them on the black market (18 U.S.C. § 371; 16 U.S.C. §§ 668(a); 3372(a)(1), 3373(d)(1)(B)).Between January 2015 and March 2021, the defendants conspired to illegally kill bald and golden eagles on the Reservation and offer eagle feathers and parts for sale to domestic U.S. and international buyers. Branson traveled from Washington to the Reservation and arranged for Paul to shoot and ship the eagles for him.&amp;nbsp;Confederated Salish &amp;amp; Kootenai tribal authorities&amp;nbsp;tipped off Fish and Wildlife agents to the defendants’ activity.In total, Paul and Branson killed approximately 3,600 birds, including eagles. They then sold eagle feathers and parts on the black market for significant sums of money across the United States and elsewhere. Officials estimated that between 2009 and 2021, Branson made between $180,000 and $360,000 by selling eagles feathers and parts on the black market.The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes’ Fish and Game Department conducted the investigation.Related Press Release:&amp;nbsp;District of Montana | Washington man sentenced to nearly four years in federal prison for trafficking eagles, hawks killed on the Flathead Indian Reservation and sold on black market | United States Department of Justice                      Case photo of eagle claws illegal sold by defendants.View All Environmental Crimes Bulletins</span>

A scam operator calling itself the “Bankruptcy Fraud Watchdog Group” has recently set its sights on consumer debtors, sending letters falsely accusing debtors of failing to disclose assets in their bankruptcy cases. These letters threaten referrals to “the United States Bankruptcy Trustee” for fraud unless the debtors promptly pay “a one-time amnesty fine” of $450 in Bitcoin via a QR code to avoid “further legal consequences.” They also falsely state that debtors who share the letters with their attorneys will face “immediate referral for criminal prosecution.”As the actual watchdog of the bankruptcy system, the U.S. Trustee Program (USTP) identifies and helps investigate allegations of fraud or abuse, including schemes exploiting vulnerable consumers in bankruptcy. Accordingly, debtors should report contacts from the so-called “Bankruptcy Fraud Watchdog Group” or other suspicious communications to the USTP’s bankruptcy fraud hotline or to their local U.S. Trustee office.Consumer debtors can help protect themselves by looking out for common signs of schemes.

  On November 13, ICITAP, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of State’s Office of Global Criminal Justice (GCJ), met with the Bangladesh Police Reform Committee (BPRC) to discuss current challenges and future plans for police reform in Bangladesh. The BPRC, led by Chief Safar Raj Hossain, outlined several areas for improvement, including revising laws and policies, addressing the "angry mob" issue, eliminating arbitrary false charges, and promoting a career prosecution service. The committee emphasized the need to remove police from political influence, reduce corruption, and improve logistics, manpower, and equipment. Additionally, they outlined short- and long-term goals to foster better police-citizen relations, transition from confession-based to scientifically based investigations, enhance human rights enforcement, and improve communication and cooperation across the police, prison, and judicial sectors. The U.S. delegation highlighted its ongoing efforts to assist Bangladesh’s law enforcement reform through targeted support, focusing on strengthening police capabilities and judicial processes. The Deputy Ambassador-at-Large for GCJ briefed the committee on U.S. work related to war crimes, human rights violations, and the recent crisis facing the country. The GCJ also provided the committee with reports detailing areas where U.S. assistance could be focused. ICITAP’s Law Enforcement Assistance Attaché (LEAA) reviewed two decades of police and prison support, offering detailed insights into opportunities for future assistance. This included a draft revision of the Bangladesh Police Ordinance (BPO), developed in partnership with senior police officials. The BPRC expressed appreciation for these contributions, particularly the draft BPO, which they planned to incorporate into their final report. At the conclusion of the meeting, the BPRC Chief thanked ICITAP and GCJ for their continued support and expressed a desire to build on this partnership to strengthen Bangladesh's police, prison, and judicial systems. The committee also requested ICITAP’s expertise in developing Basic Principles of Policing and guidance on preventing lower-ranking officers from following unlawful orders. ICITAP’s LEAA subsequently forwarded the BPO draft and a copy of the internationally recognized Basic Principles of Policing to the BPRC Chief for further review and potential inclusion in the committee's final recommendations.</span>

Policewomen on Equality and Rights (EMPoWER) program conducted a surveillance and counter surveillance training for 15 female officers in Jordan’s Public Security Directorate's (PSD) Special Branch (SB). The officers participating in the training are assigned to the SB’s Special Surveillance Unit and/or the newly established All-Female Counterterrorism Team. The training lasted three weeks in total and covered elements critical to physical surveillance operations, such as mission planning, foot and vehicle surveillance, threat recognition, among other topics. This training is the first of two iterations planned for SB in closing of 2024 activities. Via participation in this course, EMPoWER is seeking to strengthen SB’s female officer’s capacity to engage in operational assignments. EMPoWER continues to work with SB to increase the meaningful participation of women in counterterrorism law enforcement. In Jordan, ICITAP-EMPoWER is managed with the support of and in coordination with the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Counterterrorism.</span>

<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 1 Guidance on Submitting Certification of Agency Compliance with FOIA's Reading Room RequirementsOne of the recommendations contained in the May 30, 2008 Attorney General's Report to the President on agency progress under Executive Order 13,392, "Improving Agency Disclosure of Information," requires agency Chief FOIA Officers to certify to the Department of Justice and OMB that their agency Reading Rooms are in compliance with the FOIA. To do so, agency Chief FOIA Officers are asked first to conduct an internal review of their agency FOIA Reading Rooms to ensure that they contain all elements required by the law. If any deficiencies are identified, they must be addressed. Finally, by October 31, 2008, all agency Chief FOIA Officers must certify that their FOIA Reading Rooms are in compliance with the law.The issuance of Executive Order 13,392 has brought increased attention to the topic of FOIA Reading Rooms in particular, and FOIA websites more generally. The FOIA imposes requirements on agencies to maintain certain categories of agency records in agency Reading Rooms where they are made available for public inspection and copying. The Department of Justice, over the years, has issued extensive guidance to agencies on the requirements of agency FOIA Reading Rooms. That guidance is summarized and referenced in the Department of Justice's Freedom of Information Act Guide (Mar. 2007 ed.), which is available on the Department's website.As the Attorney General's Report to the President notes, "while the Executive Order has prompted improvements to agency FOIA Reading Rooms, some agencies still need to devote more attention to ensuring that, at a minimum, their Reading Rooms contain all the material that is required by the FOIA to be included there."The guidance dated June 25, 2008, set out below, was sent to Chief FOIA Officers by the Office of Information and Privacy (OIP), and addresses the Attorney General's recommendation for submission of a certification of compliance with the FOIA for each agency's FOIA Reading Room. The certification is required to be submitted first in draft form to OIP by October 17, 2008. Each agency Chief FOIA Officer must then submit the final certification to OMB and the Department of Justice by October 31, 2008.MEMORANDUM FOR AGENCY CHIEF FOIA OFFICERSFROM: Director, Office of Information and Privacy; U.S. Department of JusticeSUBJECT: Guidance on Submitting Certification of Agency Compliance with FOIA's Reading Room RequirementsThis memorandum provides guidance for providing certification to the Department of Justice and OMB by October 31, 2008 that your agency's FOIA Reading Room is in compliance with the FOIA. All agency Chief FOIA Officers must provide this certification.BACKGROUNDOn May 30, 2008, the Attorney General issued his third Report to the President pursuant to Executive Order 13,392. This Attorney General Report is based on the Fiscal Year 2007 Annual FOIA Reports that agencies submitted earlier this year and provides an update on the agencies implementation of the FOIA and of their FOIA Improvement Plans. In accordance with Section 4(a) of the Executive Order, the Attorney General's Report includes recommendations for improving agency FOIA administration. The third recommendation requires each agency Chief FOIA Officer to conduct a review of their agency's FOIA Reading Room(s); to address any deficiencies in its content; and then to certify to the Department of Justice and OMB that its Reading Room is in compliance with the requirements of the FOIA.As described in the Attorney General's Report, the Department of Justice has been actively engaged in a series of steps focused on the issue of FOIA Reading Rooms. In particular, the Department has added the topic of FOIA Reading Rooms to many of its training programs so that agency personnel are fully apprised of the requirements imposed by the FOIA for posting documents. In addition, as the Report points out, the Department of Justice has launched an initiative to reach out to those agencies that it has identified as having Reading Rooms in need of improvement. These outreach efforts will be an on-going process as agencies work to improve both their Reading Rooms and their websites overall.READING ROOM REQUIREMENTSUnder subsection (a)(2) of the FOIA, federal agencies must make four distinct categories of records affirmatively available for "public inspection and copying." Agencies must satisfy this "Reading Room" provision of the FOIA by providing the designated documents either solely in electronic Reading Rooms on agency websites, or in a combination of electronic and conventional "paper" Reading Rooms. Agencies should be mindful that the Reading Room provision of the FOIA imposes an affirmative disclosure requirement and, as such, agencies are obligated to not only maintain, but also to continuously update, each of the four categories of Reading Room records.A. Description of Reading Room RecordsAs noted above, agency Reading Rooms must contain four distinct categories of records. Agencies should organize the records in a way that allows for efficient and easy location of specific documents. This may be accomplished by physically separating the records, in the case of conventional reading rooms, or by listing the records under separate links or headings, in the case of electronic Reading Rooms. One approach is to separate the records by the four categories listed in the statute. Agencies are free to separate and organize the records in any other manner that the agency determines, from a citizen-centered perspective, will best serve the needs of the community of individuals and entities that visit and use the agency's website.The four categories of Reading Room records are:\t"final opinions [and] . . . orders" made in the adjudication of cases;\tspecific agency policy statements;\t"administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public"; and\trecords disclosed in response to a FOIA request that "the agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records."Additionally, agencies should note that records which are published and offered for sale by an agency are excluded from the definition of Reading Room records. Thus, even if a particular record would otherwise be designated a Reading Room record, if it is published and offered for sale it need not be included in the agency's Reading Room. Similarly, records published under the provisions of (a)(1) - the Federal Register requirement for publishing basic information about the organization of the agency - are to be excluded from the definition of Reading Room records.B. Reading Room IndicesAgencies should index or otherwise organize the records to facilitate their location in the Reading Room. The index requirement is met by any organizational system which substantially enables a member of the public to locate desired materials in the Reading Room. The FOIA specifically requires that agencies provide a "general index" of those records falling into the fourth Reading Room category (also known as the "frequently requested records" category). Because, as noted below, all "frequently requested" records must be posted in electronic, rather than conventional, Reading Rooms, this indexing requirement may be satisfied by simply providing a distinct "link" to each document in this category.C. Electronic Reading RoomsAgencies must make the records created by them on or after November 1, 1996 in all four Reading Room categories available to the public by "electronic means." Agencies accomplish this electronic availability through the use of electronic Reading Rooms on their FOIA websites. Because the "frequently requested records" category of Reading Room records was not effective until March 31, 1997, this category of records is, as a practical matter, always included in electronic Reading Rooms.For records created by an agency before November 1, 1996, agencies may continue to maintain conventional Reading Rooms, where paper copies of all subsection (a)(2) documents are available for inspection and copying. The location of each agency's conventional Reading Room should be indicated on its FOIA Web page. For those agencies which no longer maintain conventional Reading Rooms, a computer terminal through which a member of the public may, upon request, access the agency's electronic Reading Room must be provided. In such instances, instructions for using this arrangement should be provided on the agency's FOIA website.For additional information see Office of Management and Budget Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies Concerning Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites (Dec. 17, 2004); Office of Management and Budget Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies Concerning Improving Public Access to and Dissemination of Government Information and Using the Federal Enterprise Architecture Data Reference Model (Dec. 16, 2005).REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION OF AGENCY READING ROOMSA. Timing of the FOIA Reading Room CertificationIn order to appropriately ensure that agency certifications incorporate the components detailed below, each agency must submit a draft of their FOIA Reading Room Certification to the Department of Justice for review by October 17, 2008.Each agency Chief FOIA Officer must then submit a finalized FOIA Reading Room Certification by October 31, 2008, to both the Department of Justice and OMB. Each agency must also post their FOIA Reading Room Certification on its FOIA website.B. Preparing the FOIA Reading Room CertificationAs noted above, each agency Chief FOIA Officer must conduct an internal review of its agency's FOIA Reading Room(s), address any deficiencies identified, and certify that those Reading Rooms are in compliance with the FOIA. In order to comply with this requirement all agencies should follow the procedure set out below.\tGeneral Issues\tFOIA Reading Rooms are a required element for all agency FOIA websites. For any agency that fulfills its Reading Room requirement by maintaining multiple Reading Rooms, all such Reading Rooms should be reviewed, any deficiencies addressed, and the certification should identify each Reading Room that was reviewed.\t\tA "deficiency" in the content of a Reading Room means any failure to comply with the statutory requirements for the establishment and maintenance of a FOIA Reading Room.\t&amp;nbsp;\tTemplate for Certification of FOIA Reading Rooms\t\tEach agency Chief FOIA Officer must complete the following template for providing certification for his/her agency.\tInternal Review of Agency FOIA Reading Room\tProvide a statement that your agency FOIA Reading Room was reviewed for purposes of determining whether it was in compliance with the legal requirements for FOIA Reading Rooms. If your agency has more than one Reading Room, identify each Reading Room that was reviewed.\t&amp;nbsp;\tAny Reading Room Deficiencies Addressed\t\tProvide, if applicable, a general description of the nature of any deficiencies located during the review of the Reading Room and the corrective steps taken to address them.\t&amp;nbsp;\tCertification\t\tProvide a certification that after review and the remedying of any deficiencies, the agency's Reading Room is in compliance with the requirements of the FOIA.C. Submitting the Reading Room CertificationEach agency's Reading Room Certification must be made by the agency's Chief FOIA Officer.\tGuidelines for Submitting\tBy October 17, 2008, submit the draft Reading Room Certification for review by e-mail to DOJ.OIP.FOIA@usdoj.gov.\t\tBy October 31, 2008, submit the final, cleared Reading Room Certification to OMB at FOIAreporting@omb.eop.gov and to the Department of Justice at the e-mail noted above.\t&amp;nbsp;\tContacts\t\tAgencies with questions regarding this matter should contact Vanessa Brinkmann at the Department of Justice's Office of Information and Privacy at (202) 514-3642.</span>

                                               Presidential Statement and White House Memorandum on the FOIA Issued During Sunshine WeekOn March 16, 2010, during Sunshine Week, the White House issued both a Presidential Statement and a Memorandum on the FOIA.&amp;nbsp; First, President Obama issued a statement on the FOIA.&amp;nbsp; In his Statement, the President applauded the work that has been done so far to increase transparency.&amp;nbsp; He also recommitted his administration “to be the most open and transparent ever.”&amp;nbsp; After highlighting some of the transparency initiatives the White House has undertaken, the President concluded by stating that “our work is not done” and that “[w]e will continue to work toward an unmatched level of transparency, participation, and accountability across the entire Administration.”On that same day, Rahm Emanuel, White House Chief of Staff, and Bob Bauer, Counsel to the President, issued a Memorandum to the Heads of Departments and Agencies on the Freedom of Information Act.&amp;nbsp; The Memorandum highlights the successful work that has been done by agencies “to make the government more open and accountable to the American people.”&amp;nbsp; The White House also expressed appreciation to agencies for their efforts in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and confidence that agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports will demonstrate the progress achieved thus far.At the same time, the White House points out that “more work remains to be done, and such work requires persistent effort.”&amp;nbsp; The White House requests department and agency heads to take action in two specific areas “to ensure full implementation of the President's Memorandum on FOIA.”&amp;nbsp;First, agencies are instructed to update all their FOIA guidance and training materials “to include the principles articulated in the President's Memorandum.”&amp;nbsp; Second, the White House directs agencies to “assess whether [they] are devoting adequate resources to responding to FOIA requests promptly and cooperatively, consistent with the requirements for addressing this Presidential priority.”The Memorandum closes by noting that agencies may already be taking these and other steps as part of their drafting of their Open Government Plans, which are being developed as a result of the Open Government Directive.As these White House transmissions convey, agencies should be very proud of the work they have accomplished thus far in improving transparency.&amp;nbsp; Although there is more work to be done in the year ahead, a preliminary review of&amp;nbsp;agency Chief FOIA Officer Reports reveals that the key agencies across the government, which handle the bulk of the FOIA requests, have made real progress in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&amp;nbsp; Complete details about agency activities and progress will be forthcoming in OIP's report on its review and analysis of the Chief FOIA Officer Reports.&amp;nbsp; A summary containing highlights from those reports is available on our website.</span>

                                                     Guidance for Further Improvement Based on 2013 Chief FOIA OfficerReport Review and Assessment As illustrated by OIP's 2013 Assessment of Agency Progress in Implementing the President's and Attorney General's FOIA Memoranda, agencies have accomplished a great deal over the past year to apply the presumption of openness, make more proactive disclosures, utilize technology for the benefit of FOIA administration, improve timeliness, and reduce backlogs. While the government overall has made significant improvements, the results achieved by individual agencies vary. OIP's Assessment serves as a visual snapshot of where each agency should focus its efforts in the upcoming year to achieve even greater success in implementing the President's Memorandum on the FOIA and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines. To assist agencies, OIP offers the following guidance based on our 2013 Assessment.Focus on Quality TrainingA proper understanding of the FOIA, including the correct application of the statute's provisions and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines, is the first step towards any successful FOIA operation. OIP's Assessment shows that the vast majority of agencies are either holding training conferences or sending their FOIA professionals to training hosted by other agencies. These efforts vary by agency, though, with some agencies citing one or two training sessions attended by staff and others hosting multiple FOIA conferences and having all of their FOIA professionals attend regular training.OIP advises every agency to make FOIA training available to all their FOIA professionals at least once each year. Moreover, it is essential that FOIA training programs cover core, substantive aspects of FOIA administration. Agencies that have been engaged in robust training initiatives should continue these efforts. Agencies that are in need of training are encouraged to take advantage of the many FOIA training opportunities available around the government or to plan a comprehensive FOIA conference tailored to the needs of their own agency. OIP regularly conducts a number of government-wide training sessions that cover all aspects of the FOIA. OIP's subject matter experts are also available to provide specialized training for agencies on any FOIA topic. For more information about OIP's upcoming training events and how to attend please visit the "Training" page of our website. In addition, agencies can contact OIP’s Training Officer to arrange for assistance in holding an in-house training program.Focus on Processing “Simple” Track Requests Within Twenty Working DaysThe Attorney General has emphasized that "[t]imely disclosure of information is an essential component of transparency." The government overall showed improvement on this front with sixty-three agencies processing their "simple track" requests within an average of twenty days or less and several more being very close to meeting this goal. However, there are still a number of agencies with longer processing times. Agencies that are taking longer than an average of twenty days to process their simple requests should reexamine their FOIA process and strive to meet this milestone. Furthermore, OIP advises those agencies with high processing times that have not established multi-track processing to consider doing so. As explained in last year's guidance, multi-track systems provide a mechanism for agencies to process their simple requests in a different queue from their complex requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the simple requests. Differentiating the processing queues also allows agencies to provide requesters with meaningful choices regarding processing times, based on the complexity of the request.Focus on Closing the “Ten Oldest”Finally, all agencies should continue to make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each fiscal year. Our sustained efforts to close these requests and appeals every year is essential to reducing the age of the government's backlogs and resolving those cases that have been lingering for years.In addition to closing their oldest requests and appeals, for those agencies that receive consultations from other agencies it is equally important to close their ten oldest pending consultations. This ensures that the agencies that sent the consultations can have the responses they need in order to close out the requests.</span>

Guidance for Further ImprovementThis Guidance was issued along with the 2012 Chief FOIA Officer Report AssessmentAgencies continue to make concrete progress in implementing the President's FOIA Memorandum and the Attorney General's FOIA Guidelines.&amp;nbsp; The 2012 assessment shows that agencies are applying the presumption of openness, are taking steps to ensure that they have effective systems in place for responding to requests, are increasing both the content on their websites and its usability, and are offering requesters the opportunity to submit requests electronically.While more than half the agencies are utilizing advanced technology to help with core processing tasks like improved document searches, streamlined consultation processes, and more efficient document review, there are many that have not yet explored those options.&amp;nbsp; In this era of lean resources, as agencies face competing priorities, they understandably may also face challenges in acquiring new technology.&amp;nbsp; At the same time, agencies are encouraged to assess the cost effectiveness as well as the benefits of more advanced technological tools that could be used to achieve greater efficiency in the core elements of FOIA processing, particularly improved document searches and review.As to improving timeliness, agencies that do not currently offer multi-track processing, and which take longer than twenty working days on average to respond to requests, should consider establishing a multi-track system.&amp;nbsp; A multi-track system will provide a mechanism for the agency to process "simple" requests in a different queue from "complex" requests, which in turn can allow for improved timeliness for the "simple" track requests.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, by establishing multiple processing tracks, agencies can more readily offer requesters the option of tailoring their request so that it fits within the "simple" track and can be processed more quickly.Lastly, all agencies should make it a priority to close their ten oldest pending requests and appeals each year.&amp;nbsp; By doing so systematically, year after year, the government overall will be able to reduce the age of its backlog and eliminate those lingering requests that have remained pending for many years.&amp;nbsp;</span>
