ICITAP delegates from the Maldives, Bangladesh, Kosovo, and Indonesia were represented, together with ICITAP Corrections Advisors from Indonesia and Bangladesh, and the ICITAP-Bangladesh Deputy Law Enforcement Assistance Attaché. The delegates attended a spectrum of corrections-related workshops and public engagements with notable speakers. They also had an opportunity to share their experience with corrections professionals from around the world. ICITAP delegation also met with ACA leadership and was recognized during general assembly as one of international delegations attending the Conference.  On Friday August 5, the Indonesia delegation attended a prison tour for the Orleans Parish Jail that was tailored to the program’s pre-trial detention component, while on August 6, the rest of the group (Maldives, Bangladesh, and Kosovo) attended a private tour of the Rayburn Correctional Center to observe best practices and compare operations with their correctional institutions. To encourage regional collaboration, ICITAP organized an internal meeting for delegates to present their corrections system, and exchange best practices and innovative solutions to common challenges. During this meeting, ICITAP Corrections Advisors also provided briefings and overviews on prison intelligence, classification and categorization, and importance of safety and security.  ICITAP participation and attendance at the 2022 ACA Conference was a success that bridged relationships and built networks while providing a modern perspective of prison operations.</span>

Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 into law. The Civil Rights Division takes this opportunity to commemorate the 57th anniversary of that momentous occasion, which would not have occurred without the sacrifices of activists like those who marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama to call for voting rights for Black Americans. In what became known as ‘Bloody Sunday,’ marchers were brutally attacked by state troopers while attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. Countless Americans watching the television coverage of the mayhem were shocked by images of their fellow citizens being ruthlessly beaten by police officers for peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights.Galvanized by the events in Selma, President Johnson called for the enactment of the Voting Rights Act, ending his speech with the powerful, well-known refrain: we shall overcome. Congress met the moment by passing the Act, one of the most important and successful pieces of civil rights legislation in United States history. It aims to make the promise of the ballot box a reality for all Americans by eliminating legal barriers that prevent racial and language minority voters from having the opportunity to participate in our democracy on an equal footing.The Voting Rights Act would prove to be transformative, enfranchising millions of Americans for the first time and empowering many minority voters to elect candidates of their choice to public office. At every level of government, we now see officeholders who are more representative of America’s racial and ethnic diversity, evidence of the remarkable progress that has been made since 1965, thanks to the Act’s passage. Many of its provisions, moreover, remain critical to protecting the right to vote today.Despite the progress that’s been made, we know that many Americans’ right to vote remains under threat and that much remains to be done to achieve fully the goal of eliminating the racial discrimination in voting that inspired the Act’s passage. Some of the current threats involve the resurgence of old tactics: improper purging of the voting rolls, moving polling places to make it more difficult for minority citizens to vote, or using redistricting plans that dilute minority voting strength. But some of them are new: cutting back on forms of voting like early voting or vote by mail that citizens have increasingly come to rely on, engaging in online disinformation campaigns, or limiting the provision of food or water to citizens waiting in long lines to cast their votes.In the face of these challenges, as Attorney General Merrick Garland has said, “the Department of Justice will never stop working to protect the democracy to which all Americans are entitled.” For example, just this past year, the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice filed two lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act against the State of Texas (here and here) and Galveston County, and filed amicus briefs or statements of interest in VRA cases in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, North Dakota, and Texas (here and here) and worked on a number of other voting matters. The Department also filed briefs in VRA or other voting matters in the Third, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits as well as the U.S. Supreme Court in Merrill v. Milligan and Merrill v. Caster, an important matter involving Alabama’s 2021 congressional districting plan.We at the Civil Rights Division will continue to protect the right to vote by using all of the tools available under the Voting Rights Act as well as the Civil Rights Act, Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, National Voter Registration Act, Help America Vote Act, and Americans with Disabilities Act, among others.

National Night Out (NNO) is a decades-long program designed to join neighborhoods together and enhance partnerships between law enforcement and the communities they serve. Through NNO, participants learn about crime and drug prevention programs, strengthen bonds with local law enforcement, and enhance neighborhood unity. Across the Central District, thousands of events were held. The events range from block parties to festivals and parades including LAPD, LASD and other local law enforcement agencies. Legal Assistant Robert Perry attended the event with Burbank Police Department and AUSA Jenn Chou attended the LAPD event in Wilshire Division.</span>

During this visit, the ICITAP senior law enforcement advisors (SLEAs) assessed the procedures and updated conditions of the three primary counterterrorism courts in Tunis, Tunisia. These courts include the Court of First Instance (CoFI), Court of Appeals (CoA) and the Judicial Pole (JP). This project began with an initial assessment in December 2018, and during this period, ICITAP has been collaborating with the United Nations Office for Project Services in Tunisia (UNOPS) to carry out the objectives of the project. UNOPS was tasked with completing facility and construction upgrades at each of the courts. On the final day of the assessment, ICITAP donated five hand-held security metal detector wands to the Court Security Unit. In total, ICITAP has donated 20 hand-held metal detectors to the Court Security Unit. Following the donations, the SLEAs held a training for four Court Security Officers on how to properly use the metal detector wands. These four officers have been tasked by the Head of the Court Security Unit to teach their fellow officers.  The wands are planned to be used at the initial screening stations of the jail cells and outside of the courts during counterterrorism related trials. In Tunisia, ICITAP works with the support of the Department of State’s Bureau of Counterterrorism.</span>
<span class="r-out co"><span class="r-pr">#&gt;</span> 5 Thirty-two years ago, Congress passed the Americans With Disabilities Act, which makes it illegal to discriminate against people with disabilities. It’s an important law upholding our nation’s civil rights – and it is why we commemorate Disability Pride Month in July. This month is a powerful reminder about the importance of disability rights and why, as a federal partner of the anti-violence movement, we celebrate people with disabilities and honor all the achievements the community has accomplished. The Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) reaffirms our commitment to ensuring access and inclusion while rejecting all forms of ableism.    At OVW, we recognize the survivors and advocates who are building responses to address the unique struggles that people with disabilities face every day in the criminal justice system. While there are limited statistics available, we know that people with disabilities are at least three times more likely to be victims of violent crimes than those without disabilities. These crimes are often underreported – only 19% of rapes or sexual assaults against people with disabilities are reported to police, compared to 36% of those against people without disabilities. Survivors with certain disabilities are more susceptible than others to violent crime, such as those with intellectual or cognitive disabilities, psychiatric disabilities, or more than one disability.Survivors with physical and cognitive disabilities, as well as hearing loss, can face insurmountable barriers if the justice system and service organizations are not equipped to meet them where they are and provide accessible services. Only 12% of victims of violent crimes with disabilities receive support from victim service organizations. Communities deserve access to crisis line workers who are familiar with text telephone (TTY) or video relay service (VRS) technology, and American Sign Language interpreters trained in the dynamics of domestic violence and sexual assault. Further, survivors benefit when there are strong multidisciplinary collaborative relationships among service providers, law enforcement, and the court systems.That is why community organizations dedicated to helping survivors who are disabled are so important. Through our Training and Services to End Violence Against Disabilities Grant Program, OVW provides support to programs and community networks working closely to center the needs of survivors and address the unique – and sometimes compounding – challenges they face. Grantees work across the spectrum: they provide disability-competent care that recognizes and treats each individual as a whole person; they implement services with assistive technology that aids mobility, hearing, and sight; and they educate community networks about how to better serve survivors.Here are just a few examples of the work being done by OVW grantees through our Disability Program:The Journey Center for Safety and Healing in Cleveland, Ohio, utilized OVW funding to provide support for victims with hearing loss during court proceedings, legal appointments, weekly support groups, and employment assistance. The organization also promoted awareness at major events in the community, and provided Cleveland first responders with tools to effectively communicate with victims who are disabled or Deaf.\tDomestic Violence Intervention Services in Oklahoma hired a project coordinator who specializes in working with victims who have hearing loss. Staff members learned basic sign language and say they are more comfortable helping clients who are Deaf.\tDisability Rights Washington, based in Seattle, worked with community partners to build policies and procedures to support survivors with disabilities or hearing loss. The organization has also been able to identify problems and assist survivors who live in long-term care facilities.During July, we celebrate these successes and accomplishments while also acknowledging the critical need to reach more survivors with disabilities. Grantees tell us they want to be more accessible to survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking who have physical disabilities, improve communication with survivors who are cognitively impaired, work more closely with guardians of adult survivors who are disabled, and provide additional services to survivors who have severe mental illness and/or abuse substances. They want to offer more community education and outreach, create awareness about domestic violence and sexual assault services that are available for people with disabilities, educate people with intellectual disabilities about sex, consent, and healthy relationships, and much more.We’re eager to do our part. As we mark the 32nd anniversary of the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act and celebrate Disability Pride Month, OVW is proud to partner with those champions broadening access to services and tirelessly advocating for survivors.</span>

Attendees were trained to recognize money laundering when they encounter it in the field, the methodology of basic and advanced money laundering techniques, the criminal abuse of shell companies both domestically and overseas to hide and move assets, and investigative techniques to combat the threat. Attendees were provided with key indicators or “red flags” indicative of terrorist financing, related to either commercial business operations or non-govern mental organizations. The last day of training culminated with a simulation involving a series of events requiring law enforcement and civilian regulatory personnel to successfully work together as a cohesive task force during the simulations. This model of collaboration is encouraged to continue in the field upon completion of this specialized training. Following this training, monitoring and evaluation from attendees indicated the training provided was well received and a resounding success. In Pakistan, ICITAP works with the support of and in coordination with the State Department’s Bureau of Counterterrorism.</span>

Public Information; agency rules, opinions, orders, records, and proceedings &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public-- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(E) each amendment, revision or repeal of the foregoing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof, a person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be adversely affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal Register and not so published. For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying-- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases[;], &lt;em&gt;if the final opinions or orders are cited, used, or relied on as precedent by the agency; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register; and &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. To the extent required to prevent a&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; [clearly] unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction. However, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made available or published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency only if-- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;   &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3)&lt;em&gt;(A)&lt;/em&gt; Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, each agency, upon any request &lt;em&gt;by any United States person&lt;/em&gt; for records which [(A)] &lt;em&gt;(i)&lt;/em&gt; reasonably describes such records and [(B)] &lt;em&gt;(ii)&lt;/em&gt; is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to [any person] &lt;em&gt;the requester.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(B) A requester shall not make or maintain a request under this paragraph for records relating to the subject matter of an  ongoing judicial or adjudicatory administrative proceeding (civil or criminal) to which the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in making the request, is a party &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(C) An agency may require by regulation that each request for records under this section include declarations by the requester that the requester, or any person upon whose behalf the requester acts in  making the request, is: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i) a United States person as defined in this section, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ii) not barred by subsection (a) (3) (B) from making the request. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A request that does not comply with any such regulation requirement is not a proper request under this section. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) (A) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying a uniform schedule of fees applicable to all constituent units of such agency. &lt;em&gt;The schedule may provide for the payment of all costs reasonably attributable to responding to the request, including the costs of searching for, reviewing, and duplicating requested records.&lt;/em&gt; [Such fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication and provide for recovery of only the direct costs of such search and duplication.] &lt;em&gt;If the requested records contain commercially valuable technological or reference information, generated or acquired by the government at substantial cost to the public, fees may be charged which reflect the fair market value or royalties or both, in addition to or in lieu of any processing fees otherwise chargeable, taking into account such factors as the estimated commercial value of the information, its cost to the government, and any public interest served by its disclosure&lt;/em&gt;. Documents shall be furnished without charge or at a reduced charge where the agency determines, &lt;em&gt;in the exercise of its discretion,&lt;/em&gt; that waiver or reduction of the fee is in the public interest because furnishing the information can be considered as primarily benefiting the general public. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(B) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying  procedures by which--&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i) a submitter may be required to designate, at the time of submission, any information consisting of trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information, which is exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4);&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ii) the agency shall notify the submitter that a request has been made for information provided by the submitter within a reasonable time prior to a decision to release any such information;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(iii) the submitter may, within 10 working day of the forwarding of such notification, submit to the agency written objection to such disclosure specifying all grounds upon which it is contended that the information should not be disclosed; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(iv) the agency shall notify the submitter of any final decision to release such information.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(C) An agency is not required to notify a submitter pursuant to subparagraph (B) if-- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i) the information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with agency regulations promulgated pursuant to paragraph (4)(B)(i), if such designation is required by the agency; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ii) the agency determines, prior to giving such notice, that the request should be denied; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(iii) the disclosure is required by law (other than this section); or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(iv) the information lawfully has been published or otherwise made available to the public. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(D) If a submitter has objected pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), to disclosure of information that the agency determines to be exempt from disclosure under subsection (b)(4), the agency shall not release such information unless the agency determines in writing that the failure to disclose the records would injure an overriding public interest and disclosure is not otherwise prohibited by law&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(B)]&lt;em&gt; (E)&lt;/em&gt; On complaint&lt;em&gt; filed by a requester within 90 days from the date of final agency action or by a submitter prior to the release of submitted information,&lt;/em&gt; the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has jurisdiction--&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i)&lt;/em&gt; to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from [the complainant.] &lt;em&gt;the requester; or  &lt;p&gt;(ii) to enjoin the agency from any disclosure of records which was objected to by a submitter under subparagraph (B)(iii) or which would have been objected to had notice been given as required by subparagraph (B)(ii). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(F) In an action based on a complaint--&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i) by a requester, the court shall have jurisdiction over any submitter of information &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;contained in the requested records, and any such submitter may intervene as of right in the action; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ii) by a submitier, the court shall have jurisdiction over any requester of records containing information which the submitter seeks to have withheld, and any such requester may intervene as a matter of right in the action. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(G) The agency that is the subject of the complaint shall promptly, upon service of a complaint--&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i) seeking the production of records, notify each submitter of information contained in the requested records that the complaint was filed; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ii) seeking the withholding of records, notify each requester of the records that the complaint was filed. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(H) In any action in which a requester is an intervenor or is joined the court shall on timely motion of the requester transfer the action to a district court which would have had jurisdiction had the action been brought by the requester, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(I) In a case in which a record is withheld under subsection (b)(1), the court shall not enjoin the agency from withholding such record unless the agency's action is found to be arbitrary or capricious&lt;/em&gt;. In [such a case] &lt;em&gt;all other cases&lt;/em&gt;, the court shall determine the matter de novo [,]. [and] &lt;em&gt;The court&lt;/em&gt; may examine the contents of [such] &lt;em&gt;requested&lt;/em&gt; agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section [,]. [and] &lt;em&gt;T&lt;/em&gt;[t]he burden is on the agency to sustain its action &lt;em&gt;to withhold information and the burden is on any submitter seeking the withholding of information. The court shall maintain under seal any affidavit or record submitted in camera to the court in support of the applicability of any exemption, and shall stay any order requiring the release of records pending final judicial resolution of any appeal from such order. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(C)]&lt;em&gt;(J)&lt;/em&gt; Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the defendant shall serve an answer or otherwise plead to any complaint made under this subsection within thirty days after service upon the defendant of the pleading in which such complaint is made, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(D)] &lt;em&gt;(K)&lt;/em&gt; Except as to cases the court considers of greater importance, proceedings before the district court, as authorized by this subsection, and appeals therefrom, take precedence on the docket over all cases and shall be assigned for hearing and trial or for argument at the earliest  practicable date and expedited in every way. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(E)] &lt;em&gt;(L)&lt;/em&gt; The court may assess against the United States &lt;em&gt;or any submitter who is a party to the litigation&lt;/em&gt; reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the [complainant] &lt;em&gt;requester&lt;/em&gt; has substantially prevailed. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(F)] &lt;em&gt;(M)&lt;/em&gt; Whenever the court orders the production of any agency records improperly withheld  from the complainant and assesses against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs, and the court additionally issues a written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether the agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or  employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding. The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies  of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employees or his representative. The  administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(G)] &lt;em&gt;(N)&lt;/em&gt; In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member in every agency proceeding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(6) (A) Each agency, upon request [for records] made under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection &lt;em&gt;for records which are sufficiently identified and limited that no more than eight working hours of search and review time are required to respond to the request, and which do not contain trade secrets, commercial or financial information, or other commercially valuable information provided by a submitter&lt;/em&gt;, shall-- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(i) determine within ten &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; and &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty &lt;em&gt;working&lt;/em&gt; days [(excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays)] after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(B) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of the subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the reasons for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days. As used in this subparagraph, "unusual circumstances" means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular request-- &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(i) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(ii) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(iii) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.] &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (A), each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2) or (3) of this subsection shall-- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(i) within thirty working days after the receipt of the request-- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(a) determine whether to comply with such request, in whole or in part, and immediately notify the requester of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the requester's right to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed one year; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ii) within thirty working days after the receipt of an appeal-- &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(a) make a determination of the appeal; or &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(b) notify the requester of the estimated time period required for such determination, and the reasons therefor, such time period to be established in accordance with agency regulations promulgated hereunder but not to exceed six months. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the requester of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(C) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying the time periods under subparagraph (B). Such regulations shall provide for the shortest practicable time periods and shall take into account all relevant factors, including but not limited to--&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;i) the volume of requests and appeals received by the agency; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ii) the resources available to the agency for the processing of such requests and appeals; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(iii) the volume of records required to be searched to locate all records responsive to the request or appeal;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(iv) the volume of responsive records required to be reviewed for release pursuant to the request or appeal;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(v) the need to search for or review records maintained in field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the agency office processing the request or appeal; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(vi) the character of the records requested;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; (vii) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject matter interest therein; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(viii) the need for notification of submitters of information and for consideration of any objections to disclosure made by such submitters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(D) Each agency shall promulgate regulations pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, by which a requester who demonstrates a compelling need for expedited access to records and whose request for information will primarily benefit the general public may, as a matter of the agency's discretion, be given processing priority over other requesters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;[(C)] &lt;em&gt;(E)&lt;/em&gt; Any [person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection] &lt;em&gt;requester&lt;/em&gt; shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph.  &lt;em&gt;If a requester files a complaint under paragraph (4)(E), the administrative remedies of a submitter of information contained in the records which are the subject of the request shall be deemed to have been exhausted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If the Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of the records.  Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to [such a person making such request.]&lt;em&gt; the requester, except that if disclosure of records is objected to by a submitter pursuant to paragraph (4)(B)(iii), the agency shall not disclose the records for fifteen working days after notice of the final decision to release the requested information has been forwarded to the submitter&lt;/em&gt;.  Any notification of denial of any request for records under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of such request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(7) An agency is not required to disclose any material requested under this subsection which consists of newspaper clippings, magazine articles, court records, publications available from the Government Printing Office, or any similar items which are in the public record or otherwise publicly available, but the agency shall inform the requester of the nature of such public source material&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;em&gt;(8) Nothing in this section shall be deemed applicable in any way to the informant records maintained by a law enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal identifier, whenever access to such records is sought by a third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(b) This section does not apply to matters that are-- &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(1) (A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;

&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) trade secrets, and commercial or financial information &lt;em&gt;or other commercially valuable information,&lt;/em&gt; obtained from [a] &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; person [and] &lt;em&gt;if the information is&lt;/em&gt; privileged or [confidential] &lt;em&gt;if its release may impair either the legitimate competitive, financial, or business interests of any person or the government's ability to obtain such information in the future; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(6) [personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure]&lt;em&gt; records or information concerning individuals the release&lt;/em&gt; of which would constitute a&lt;em&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; [clearly] unwarranted invasion of personal privacy[;], &lt;em&gt;including compilations of lists of names and addresses that could be used for solicitation purposes; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(7) [investigatory] records &lt;em&gt;or information&lt;/em&gt; compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such records or information would (A) [interfere with] &lt;em&gt;reveal investigatory information&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;relating to an ongoing investigation&lt;/em&gt; or enforcement proceeding[s], (B) deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) &lt;em&gt;tend to&lt;/em&gt; disclose the identity of a confidential source, &lt;em&gt;including any foreign, state, or other public agency or authority or any private institution that furnished information on a confidential basis,&lt;/em&gt; and, in the case of a record &lt;em&gt;or information&lt;/em&gt; compiled by a criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation, or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, [confidential] information furnished [only] by [the] &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; confidential source, (E) disclose [investigative] techniques, [and] procedures, &lt;em&gt;guidelines, or priorities for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, &lt;/em&gt;[&lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt;] (F) endanger the life or physical safety of [law enforcement personnel]&lt;em&gt; any natural person,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;or (G) disclose information relating to such categories of investigations of terrorism, organized crime, or foreign counterintelligence as are defined by the Attorney General by regulation or order; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(8) contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; [or] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(9) geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells[.]; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;em&gt;(10) records generated by the United States or any party in connection with the settlement of a legal action in which the United States is a party or has an interest; or &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;em&gt;(11) technical data that may not be exported lawfully outside the United States without an approval, authorization, or a license from an agency, unless the requester has obtained the appropriate approval, authorization, or license. &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(c) This section does not authorize withholding of information or limit the availability of records to the public, except as specifically stated in this section. This section is not authority to withhold information from Congress. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(d) On or before March 1 of each calendar year, each agency shall submit a report covering the preceding &lt;em&gt;fiscal &lt;/em&gt;[calendar] year to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate for referral to the appropriate committees of the Congress. This report shall include--&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(1) the number of determinations made by such agency not to comply with requests for records made to such agency under subsection (a) and the reasons for each such determination; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) the number of appeals made by persons under subsection (a) (6) the result of such appeals, and the reason for the action upon each appeal that results in a denial of information; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(3) the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of records requested under this section, and the number of instances of participation for each;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(4) the results of each proceeding conducted pursuant to subsection (a)(4)[(F)]&lt;em&gt;(M),&lt;/em&gt; including a report of the disciplinary action taken against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for improperly withholding records or an explanation of why disciplinary action was not taken; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(5) a copy of every rule made by such agency regarding this section; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(6) a copy of the fee schedule and the total amount of fees collected by the agency for making records available under this section; and &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(7) such other information as indicates efforts to administer fully this section. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The  Attorney General shall submit an annual report on or before March 1 of each calendar year which shall include for the prior [calendar] &lt;em&gt;fiscal &lt;/em&gt;year a listing of the number of cases arising under this section, the exemption involved in each case, the disposition of such case, and the cost, fees, and penalties assessed under subsections (a)(4)[(E)]&lt;em&gt;(L)&lt;/em&gt;, [(F)]&lt;em&gt;(M)&lt;/em&gt;, and [(G)]&lt;em&gt;(N)&lt;/em&gt;.

                                                                                    &lt;strong&gt;FOIA Update &lt;br /&gt;Vol. III, No. 1 &lt;br /&gt;1981&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;FOIA Reform Proposed&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Efforts to amend the Freedom of Information Act continue on Capitol Hill. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Major highlights of the efforts to amend the FOIA have been the presentation of the Administration's proposal (see pp. 3-8 of &lt;em&gt;FOIA Update&lt;/em&gt;) by Assistant Attorney General Jonathan C. Rose of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy, and subsequent hearings on this proposal (S. 1751/H.R. 4805) and on a similar proposal, S. 1730, Senator Orrin G. Hatch's FOIA reform bill. Senator Hatch is chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the Judiciary   Committee. The Hatch subcommittee has held six hearings on the need for FOIA reform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In presenting the Administration's proposal on Oct. 15, Assistant Attorney General Rose declared that the Administration stands "fully committed to carrying out the philosophy and spirit of the Act." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rose told the Hatch subcommittee that the Administration is "concerned that in some instances the Freedom of Information Act has been used in ways that are inconsistent with the original objectives of the Congress." These include efforts for disclosures which have "interfered unduly with proper law enforcement activities and national security functions," Rose said. He also pointed to the considerable expense involved in FOIA processing and the diversion of agency resources from program responsibilities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Office of Legal Policy began its comprehensive review of the need for FOIA reform in May of this year by asking federal agencies to comment on problems encountered in administering the FOIA and to recommend specific changes in the law. The Administration's legislative proposal represents a synthesis of these recommendations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Administration's proposal includes two additional exemptions to the existing nine; clarification of several existing exemptions; modifications of provisions to allow for new time limits and fee assessments; additional procedures and protections for business information; and new provisions which would preclude use of the FOIA by persons other than U.S. citizens and by parties to lawsuits who have discovery rights. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Substantive amendments to the current FOIA exemptions include: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption 1&lt;/strong&gt;--The standard for judicial review with respect to classified records is proposed to be the "arbitrary or capricious" standard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption 2&lt;/strong&gt;--The proposal extends confidentiality to manuals and instructions to investigators, inspectors, auditors and negotiators, and also to examination material used in employment, certification or licensing. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption 4&lt;/strong&gt;--The Administration's bill would enlarge the protection accorded business records by providing that such records are exempt if their release "may impair either the legitimate competitive, financial, or business interests of any person or the government's ability to obtain such information in the future." In addition, the bill provides procedures by which submitters of such information may have input into agency disclosure determinations. Finally, courts deciding "reverse FOIA" cases would review agency disclosure decisions according to a &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; standard. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption 6&lt;/strong&gt;--The Administration's bill extends personal privacy protection to "records or information concerning individuals"; changes the balancing standard from a "clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy" to an "unwarranted invasion of personal privacy"; and exempts compilations of names and addresses that could be used for solicitation purposes. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exemption 7&lt;/strong&gt;--The Administration's bill makes the following changes: broadening of the exemption's threshold language; addition of language to ensure that investigatory information related to ongoing investigations is fully protected; protection of information that would "tend to" disclose the identity of a confidential source; and modification of existing language to further protect confidential sources. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill would also provide an exemption for material related to investigations of terrorism, organized crime or foreign counterintelligence, where designated by the Attorney General. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Two additional exemptions would allow agencies to protect records generated in settlement of a legal action and technical data which may not be exported outside of the United States without agency approval. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill also provides for two new standards for assessing fees. The first one authorizes fees for the full costs attributable to the processing of requested records. The second permits assessments which reflect the true value of valuable technological or reference information. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On the problem of time limits, the administration proposal would retain the 10-day time limits for material which can be processed without complication in eight working hours or less. Agencies could take up to a year to respond to more complex or voluminous requests and requests where the interests of a submitter are involved, but would have to provide a specific time estimate and explanation within 10 working days of receipt. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Administration bill also addresses the problem of the use of FOIA for discovery purposes by prohibiting a party to a judicial or administrative proceeding from filing a FOIA request for records relating to he subject matter of the proceeding. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Consideration of the Administration's package and of S. 1730 continued in the Senate Subcommittee on he Constitution during November.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rep. Glenn English, chairman of he House Subcommittee on Government Information and Individual Rights, also has held hearings on the Freedom of Information Act and has indicated that he will consider further hearings and markup of a bill after the Senate takes action. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to:  &lt;a href="/oip/foi-upd.htm"&gt;FOIA Update Home Page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</span>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     &lt;strong&gt;FOIA Update &lt;br /&gt;Vol. III, No. 1 &lt;br /&gt;1981&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Recordkeeping Procedures Examined&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;With few exceptions, records in the physical possession of a federal agency are subject to the Freedom of Information Act. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Agencies do not, however, have to retain indefinitely all records which are created by or submitted to them. Under the Federal Records Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3102 and § 3103, agencies are required to establish records management programs which identify records that should be preserved and to plan for the storage and disposal of records having only temporary significance. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It is estimated that only about five percent of government records, because of their administrative, legal, research or other value, become part of the permanent national collection. For a variety of reasons, many more records are retained for longer periods of time than are required. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In addition, some materials can be returned to submitters in the private sector, because of the circumstances under which they were obtained, once there is no longer a need for them. Agencies should be aware that once a Freedom of Information Act request has been received, the requested records assume a special status and ordinarily must be retained until the requester's access rights are determined. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Federal records, generally speaking, fall into two categories: administrative materials which are standard throughout the entire government and for which there is a schedule for retention and disposition furnished by the National Archives and Records Service (NARS), and other materials which are related to the kinds of programs conducted by the individual agencies. Individual schedules for retention and final disposition of records are developed by agency personnel in consultation with the Archivist of the United States. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;The Justice Effort &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt;At the Justice Department, there is a full scale effort underway to help managers and clerical workers focus on files maintenance and records disposition practices. Under the guidance of Bernie Berglind of the Justice Management Division's Records and Publications Staff, a course in files maintenance and records disposition will be given five times in 1982, beginning with a class Jan. 5-6. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the course, Berglind points out that almost every move made in government generates paperwork. Some of this material--for example, reading files, informational copies and acknowledgments--need not be kept. Other routine material need not be kept for as long as some offices may keep it. In fact, a significant portion is covered by the routine retention and disposal schedule. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;At the FAA &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has reviewed a great deal of material in the complex process of certifying the airworthiness of airplanes and the safety of parts and modifications. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At first, the FAA took the position that this material -- called Type Design    Data -- was the sort of "agency records" required to be retained.    Although this information was generally thought to be in large part protected    under Exemption 4 of the FOIA, it was often sought by tort litigants involved    in suits against both large and small manufacturers. "A classic use of    the FOIA in place of discovery," notes John Walsh, chief of the General    Law Branch, FAA. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then came two Supreme Court decisions clarifying what constitutes an "agency record" under the FOIA. "Two recent Supreme Court decisions establish that the Government has no obligation, and perhaps no right, to consider manufacturers' technical data not in its possession to be agency records covered by the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552.&lt;em&gt; Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press&lt;/em&gt;, 445 U.S. 136 (1980); &lt;em&gt;Forsham v. Harris&lt;/em&gt;, 445 U.S. 169 (1980)," Walsh noted in a memo. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He then concluded that technical data which "never physically reaches FAA premises because it is examined by designees of the Administrator is not 'obtained' by the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Further, "technical data which has been returned by the FAA to the manufacturer before a FOIA request for it is received, because the FAA has no current need for it, is not in the possession or control of the FAA and, therefore, is not susceptible to disclosure under the FOIA . . ."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The FAA's new policy includes an agreement with the manufacturers that secures the records should a court disagree with agency policy or should there be some question as to the business future of a manufacturer. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;strong&gt;The Antitrust Division &lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Justice Department's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission follow similar procedures related to return of materials. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the Antitrust Division, there is a long-standing practice of returning documents submitted in response to a grand jury subpoena or a civil investigative demand, once the investigation is completed. Rules for limiting the retention of these documents are spelled out in a Division Directive dated Dec. 18, 1980. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For case law authorizing the practice of returning subpoenaed documents see &lt;em&gt;Application of Bendix Aviation Corp.&lt;/em&gt;, 58 F. Supp. 953 (S.D.N.Y. 1945), and &lt;em&gt;In re Petroleum Industry Investigation&lt;/em&gt;, 152 F. Supp. 646 (E.D. Va. 1957). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At the FTC, Jack Schwartz, deputy assistant general counsel, said that the 96th Congress, apparently noting that DOJ's practices seemed to be working, "in essence required the FTC to adopt a formal practice" of returning original documents to submitters. The FTC would keep copies, only as needed, Schwartz says. The FTC regulation, adopted in accord with P.L. 96-252, states that "[A]ny person who has submitted documentary material to the Commission may file a written request for the return of original documents which have not been received into evidence (1) after the close of the proceeding in connection with which the documents were submitted, or (2) when no proceeding in which the material may be used has been commenced within a reasonable time . . ."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In sum, the timely application of destruction schedules and other record disposition techniques can result in superior records management and less costly FOIA searches.

                                                                                                                    &lt;strong&gt;FOIA Update &lt;br /&gt;Vol. III, No. 1 &lt;br /&gt;1981&lt;/strong&gt;    &lt;h2&gt;Significant New Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Worthington Compressors, Inc., et al. v. Costle&lt;/em&gt;, Nos. 80-1010, 80-1011, 80-1012, 80-1013 (D.C. Cir., Aug. 20, 1981).&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in this case expanded the availability of FOIA Exemption 4 by identifying a new factor to be considered when determining if submitted business material is confidential. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four manufacturers of portable air compressors who submitted reports on their    products to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were the appellants in    this case. They requested confidential treatment for their information, but    the agency rejected their objections to disclosure on the grounds that the information    could be duplicated by anyone with access to the air compressors through "reverse    engineering." The manufacturers then sought to enjoin release in the district    court. They contended that the information constituted confidential commercial    information and should be withheld under Exemption 4. Further, they alleged    that the reverse engineering which could be undertaken to determine the design    and engineering specifications of their compressors would be so expensive as    to be commercially impracticable. The district court below sustained the agency    and ordered disclosure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The court of appeals, however, reversed. In determining whether information    is confidential in Exemption 4 cases, the circuit court said it is proper to    determine "whether release of the requested information, given its commercial    value to competitors and the cost of acquiring it through other means, will    cause substantial competitive harm to the business that submitted it."    Accordingly, the court concluded, consideration should be given to how costly    it would be for a possible competitor to obtain the information through means    other than the FOIA and whether FOIA disclosure would constitute a windfall    to the requester. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bast v. U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/em&gt;, Nos. 79-2039, 80-1050    (D.C. Cir., Sept. 10, 1981). &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This case grew out of a hearing in a previous case. Richard Bast, a private    investigator, alleged that U.S. District Judge John Pratt improperly induced    a court reporter to expunge a portion of a hearing transcript in the earlier    case. Bast then requested access to all FBI documents compiled during the investigation    into the allegation. After the FBI released approximately 600 pages of such    documents, Bast brought suit challenging all withholdings. With a few exceptions,    the district court agreed that the remaining documents were exempt from disclosure.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On appeal, 12 documents remained at issue. The agency asserted that all of    the withheld material fell within Exemption 7(C) -- the investigatory records    exemption relating to personal privacy. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals said    that while Exemption 7(C) affords broad privacy rights to "suspects, witnesses    and investigators," there still must be a case-by-case balancing of privacy    rights against the public interest in disclosure. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After reviewing the documents &lt;em&gt;in camera&lt;/em&gt; the court decided that, with    one exception, the privacy interest outweighed the public interest. The unique    exception is a three sentence passage containing comments by the judge which    the circuit court found could be interpreted as revealing a bias. "The    public importance of judicial impartiality outweighs the privacy interest in    this case," the court ruled in ordering disclosure of that passage. A petition    for rehearing has been filed by the Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brown v. Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/em&gt;, 658 F.2d 71 (2d    Cir. 1981).&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In this case, a convicted kidnapper sought access to detailed information from    FBI files regarding his kidnaping victim. He argued that the victim had waived    her privacy rights by testifying at his trial and that, in any event, he had    an overriding need for the information in order to attack his conviction. The    Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that the requested information    was properly withheld under Exemption 6 and rejected the plaintiffs arguments.    After finding the requested information to be sufficiently personal to satisfy    the "similar files" threshold of Exemption 6, the court of appeals    held that the victim's testimony at the trial did not constitute a waiver of    "her right to keep private other related matters." Most significantly,    the court of appeals found the plaintiff's stated interest in using such information    to obtain a new trial to be "too uncertain, indirect, and remote"    to overcome the victim's privacy interests in nondisclosure. (A somewhat contrary    outcome on this latter point was reached by the Third Circuit Court of Appeals    in&lt;em&gt; Ferri v. Bell&lt;/em&gt;, published at 645 F.2d 1213, earlier this year, but    that decision was vacated on Oct. 23 by the Third Circuit and scheduled for    reargument.) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radovich v. United States Attorney, District of Maryland&lt;/em&gt;,    658 F.2d 957 (4th Cir. 1981). &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Confidential" as used in the first clause of Exemption 7(D) does    not mean "secret;" rather, it means "given in confidence"    or "in trust," the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit made clear    in this case. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The court below had found that the information sought by the plaintiff in this    case was not protected because it was publicly known that the source had spoken    with government prosecutors. Accordingly, said the district court, the identity    of the source -- an attorney for an individual involved in the criminal investigation    -- was "neither confidential nor at issue." In overruling the district    court, the circuit court of appeals concluded that the first clause of Exemption    7(D) serves to protect the attorney's conversations so long as the information    was given under an express assurance of confidentiality or in circumstances    where such an assurance could reasonably be assumed. Public knowledge of the    source's identity is irrelevant, the appellate court found. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Fourth Circuit also examined the second clause of Exemption 7(D), which    the district court has found likewise inapplicable, and construed it broadly    as well. The circuit court found that Congress intended to protect all of the    information furnished by a confidential source "in the course of a criminal    investigation, irrespective of whether the information might have been available    from some other source." &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Go to:  &lt;a href="/oip/foi-upd.htm"&gt;FOIA Update Home Page&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;</span>
